        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The Consumer Behavior questionnaire (variable name prefix CBQ) section provides interview data on food expenditures at the family level as part of the Flexible Consumer Behavior Survey (FCBS) module. </p>
<p>The FCBS module has been included in the NHANES since 2007. This module was developed in collaboration with the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It was designed to collect information on respondents&rsquo; knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward nutrition and food choices. The original FCBS module has two elements: a core set of questions asked in the household interview, and a supplementary module asked as a telephone follow-up interview with focuses specifically designed for each 2-year data collection cycle. Starting 2011, data collection for the FCBS supplementary module was discontinued.</p>
<p>The core set of the FCBS module collects information on dietary-related consumer behavior in participants&rsquo; families. For example, family monthly income and family assets, food expenditures, as well as family&rsquo;s participation on federal food assistance programs. The family food expenditures data are released in the present CBQ section, while the monthly income and family assets data are included in the Income (INQ), and food program participation data are included in the Food Security (FSQ) sections.</p>
<p>The core set of the FCBS module also includes questions on individual participant&rsquo;s food choices, such as getting meals prepared away from home, meals got from fast food or pizza places, use of convenience foods or ready-to-eat meals bought in stores, and participant&rsquo;s awareness on federal nutrition programs. These individual-level questions, in the core set of FCBS module, are included in the Diet Behavior and Nutrition (DBQ) questionnaire section and released in a separate file.
</p>
<p>
Similar to other datasets in the NHANES 2015-2016 release cycle, all FCBS related data files can be linked by the respondent sequence number (SEQN). The complete <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/questionnaires/FCBS_I.pdf" target="_blank">2015-2016 FCBS module</a> is available at the NHANES website. For more information on the other FCBS related data refer to the documentations accompanying the datasets.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All participants were eligible.</p><h2 id="Interview_Setting_and_Mode_of_Administration">Interview Setting and Mode of Administration</h2><p>These questions were asked as part of the NHANES Family Questionnaire in the home, using the Computer-Assisted Personal interview (CAPI) system. Hand cards showing response categories were also used for some questions. One respondent in each family answered these questions.</p><h2 id="Quality_Assurance_&amp;_Quality_Control">Quality Assurance &amp; Quality Control</h2><p>The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in defining key terms used in the questionnaire. All of the data was reviewed by the NHANES field office staff for accuracy and completeness.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Frequency counts were checked, "skip" patterns were verified, and the reasonableness of question responses was reviewed. Edits were made to some variables to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic usefulness of the data. Edits were also made, when necessary, to address data disclosure concerns. When a variable was modified globally, as part of the editing process, the third letter in the variable name was changed from a Q (i.e., CBQ) to a D (i.e., CBD). For example, some data were collected using two variables (a number variable and a unit of measure variable), but combined into a single variable for data release purposes.</p>
<p><strong>CBD071, CBD091, CBD111, CBD121, and CBD131 </strong><br />
(Food expenditures &ndash; Money spent on food in the past 30 days).</p>
<p>This information was collected using two-part (number and unit) questions to allow respondents to report the amount of money as either per week or per month. The released variables were edited to standardize the reported amount to number of dollars in the last 30 days. In the 2015-2016 survey cycle, a probe was added to the introduction to ask the respondent to exclude money spent on alcoholic beverages when answering this series of food expenditure questions. Therefore, variables derived from this series of questions carried different names from previous cycles to reflect this change. In addition, minor modifications were made to the wording of questions on money spent on food at stores other than grocery stores (i.e., CBQ101 and CBQ111) to help respondents focus their answers on these stores.</p>
<p>Reported expenditures at or more than $8,400 in the past 30 days were coded as &ldquo;$8,400 and over&rdquo; due to disclosure concerns. This cut-point is consistent with the top category used in reporting family monthly income.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">NHANES Analytic Guidelines</a> and the on-line&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/" target="_blank">NHANES Tutorial</a> for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
