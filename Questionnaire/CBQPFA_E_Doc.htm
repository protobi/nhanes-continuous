        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The Consumer Behavior Phone Follow-up Module - Adult (CBQPFA) section provides personal interview data for participants 16 years and older on various dietary related consumer behavior topics. This is a new section for the NHANES 2007-2008. Topics included in the section are:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Factors that influence decisions to eating out&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Use of nutrition information labeled for restaurant foods&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Awareness of MyPyramid program and knowledge of its recommendations&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Fatalistic attitudes about body weight&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Attitudes about changing current diet&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Factors that influence food choices at a grocery store or supermarket&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Use of food labels&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Use of organic foods </li>
</ul>
<p>In 2007, a Flexible Consumer Behavior Survey (FCBS) module was added to the NHANES. This module was developed in collaboration with the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It was designed to collect information on people&rsquo;s knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward nutrition and food choices. </p>
<p>The FCBS module has two elements: a core set of questions asked in the household interview, and a supplementary module asked in a 15-minute telephone follow-up interview with focuses specifically designed for each 2-year data collection cycle. </p>
<p>Data from the core set of questions in the 2007-2008 FCBS module have been included in the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diet Behavior (DBQ)</span> and&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consumer Behavior (CBQ)</span> sections and released in separate files available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2007" target="_blank">NHANES website</a>. </p>
<p>The FCBS supplementary phone follow up module was designed to be administered differently depending upon the survey participant&rsquo;s age. For participants ages 16 years and older, we were interested in how their behavior would related to their own diet and health. Therefore, the data were collected at personal level - each participant answered the questions for themselves. For children ages 1-15 years old, the research interest was to see how the adults&rsquo; beliefs and behaviors can be related to the intake of children in the family. For example, the fast food buying habits of an adult may relate to the dietary intake of the children in the same family. Therefore, the FCBS phone follow up data were collected at the family level for children 1-15 years old. The questions were asked to one adult respondent in the family, the data were then linked to all eligible children in the home. The adult was not providing a proxy response for the child but giving his/her own information in this interview. </p>
<p>To be consistent with the design of the instrument, data from the FCBS supplementary phone follow up module are released in two separate files based on the target groups: a SP-level dataset (CBQPFA_E) for survey participants 16 years and older, and a family-level dataset (<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2007-2008/cbqpfc_e.htm" target="_blank">CBQPFC_E</a> ) for participants 1-15 years old. </p>
<p>Similar to other datasets in the NHANES 2007-2008 release cycle, all FCBS related data files can be linked by the respondent sequence number (SEQN). For more information on the other FCBS related data, refer to the documentations accompanying the datasets. </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All NHANES participants ages 1 years and older who complete a dietary interview in the mobile examination center (MEC) are eligible to participate in the FCBS follow up interview. </p>
<p>Only data from survey participants ages 16 years and older are included in this dataset. Data collected for participants 1-15 years old are released in a separate dataset (i.e.,&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2007-2008/cbqpfc_e.htm" target="_blank">CBQPFC_E</a> ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Interview_Setting_and_Mode_of_Administration">Interview Setting and Mode of Administration</h2><p>The FCBS follow up interview was administered to participants age 16 years and older over the telephone, after the day 2 dietary interview (Note: The day 2 dietary interviews are conducted by telephone 3-10 days after the health examination in the MEC). After the day 2 dietary interview was completed, participants were offered to continue with the FCBS interview or to have it scheduled for another day or time. </p>
<p>All the questions were asked by trained interviewers using the Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing &ndash; CATI system. A hand card booklet was given to the participants before they left the mobile exam center for them to use later during the follow up interview. When necessary, the interviewers read the hand cards to respondents. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Quality_Assurance_&amp;_Quality_Control">Quality Assurance &amp; Quality Control</h2><p>The CATI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data entry errors. CATI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in defining key terms used in the questionnaire. All of the data were reviewed by the NHANES field office staff for accuracy and completeness.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Frequency counts were checked, &ldquo;skip&rdquo; patterns were verified, and the reasonableness of question responses was reviewed. Edits were made to some variables to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic usefulness of the data. Edits were also made, when necessary, to address data disclosure concerns. When a variable was modified globally, as part of the editing process, the third letter in the variable name was changed from a Q (i.e. DIQ) to a D (i.e. DID). For example, some data were collected using two variables (a number variable and a unit of measure variable), but combined into a single variable for data release purposes.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Only participants who complete a dietary interview in the mobile examination center (MEC) are eligible to participate in the FCBS follow up interview. For the 2007-2008 NHANES, there were 6,022 individuals aged 16 years and older eligible for the FCBS follow up interview; of these 4,819 were considered respondents to the FCBS.</p>
<p>Most analyses of NHANES data use data collected in the MEC and the variable WTMEC2YR should be used for the sample weights. However, for the FCBS follow-up data, different sample weights are recommended for analysis. The dietary day one sample weight (WTDRD1) is recommended for use in analysis with data from FCBS follow-up module (either alone or when FCBS follow-up data are used in conjunction with MEC data). The set of weights WTDRD1 is applicable to the 4,819 respondents with FCBS follow-up data. Day 1 weights were constructed by taking the MEC sample weights (WTMEC2YR) and further adjusting for (a) the additional non-response and (b) the differential allocation by day of the week for the dietary intake data collection. These Day 1 weights are more variable than the MEC weights, and the sample size is smaller, so estimated standard errors using Day 1 data and Day 1 weights are larger than standard errors for similar estimates based on MEC weights. For more detailed information on the dietary Day 1 weights, refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2007-2008/drxdoc_e.htm" target="_blank">documentation</a> accompanying the dietary datasets. </p>
<p>Additional explanation of sample weights and appropriate uses are included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">NHANES Analytic Guidelines</a>.
