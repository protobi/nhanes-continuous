        <h3>Diet Behavior &amp; Nutrition (DBQ_B)</h3>
        <h4> Data File: DBQ_B.xpt</h4>
        <h5 class="left">First Published: May 2004</h5>
        <h5 class="right">Last Revised: NA</h5>
      </div>
      <div id="Sections">
        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The Diet Behavior and Nutrition (DBQ) section provides personal interview data on various nutrition topics. Many of the questions were included in NHANES II (1976-80), Hispanic HANES (1982-84), NHANES III (1988-94), and NHANES 1999-2000.</p>
<p><strong>Topics Included in the Section: </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Breastfeeding and other childhood feeding practices (&le; 6 yr) </li>
    <li>Eating-out habit (&ge; 1 yr) </li>
    <li>Dark green vegetables and dried beans or peas consumption (&ge; 2 yr) </li>
    <li>Current milk consumption pattern and types of milk (&ge; 1 yr) </li>
    <li>Milk consumption pattern throughout the life span (&ge; 20 yr) </li>
    <li>Community or government meal program participation (&ge; 60 yr): </li>
    <li>School meal program participation (4-19 yr) </li>
</ul><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>The target age groups for questions in this section vary by the topic. For example, the questions pertaining to infant nutrition and breast-feeding were asked of proxy respondents for children 6 years of age and younger; and senior meal program participation questions were asked of respondents 60 years of age and older. Please review the questionnaire and codebook carefully. Frequency counts were verified during the preparation of the file.</p><h2 id="Interview_Setting_and_Mode_of_Administration">Interview Setting and Mode of Administration</h2><p>Home Interview; In-person.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Edits were made to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic usefulness of the data. <br />
<strong>DBD020, DBD030, DBD040, DBD050, DBD060, </strong>and <strong>DBD080</strong> (Breastfeeding and other childhood feeding practices) </p>
<p>This information was collected using two-part (number and unit) questions to allow respondents to report the age of interest in either days, weeks, months, or years. The released variables were edited to standardize the reported age to number of days, using the following conversion factors: 7 days/week, 30.4 days/month and 365 days/year. </p>
<p><strong>DBD071a, DBD071b, DBD071c, DBD071d,</strong> and <strong>DBD071u </strong>(Type of milk first fed) </p>
<p>Responses to these questions were collected as &ldquo;code all that apply.&rdquo; A respondent could report more than one type of milk, and all responses were recorded. </p>
<p><strong>DBD090</strong> (Eating-out habit) </p>
<p>Respondents were asked how many times per week they had eaten meals prepared in a restaurant. If the frequency was reported as "never," the value was recoded as zero. If the frequency was reported as "less than weekly," the value was recoded as &ldquo;6666&rdquo;. </p>
<p><strong>DBD102 </strong>and <strong>DBD103</strong> (Dark green vegetables and dried beans or peas consumption) </p>
<p>This information was collected using two-part (number and unit) questions to allow respondents to report the frequency of interest as either per day, per week, per month, or per year. The released variables were edited to standardize the reported frequency to number of times per month, using the following conversion factors: 7 days/week, 30.4 days/month and 365 days/year. If the frequency was reported as "never," the value was recoded as zero. If the frequency was less than monthly, the value was recoded as &ldquo;66666&rdquo;. It is important to note that the portion sizes were not defined, and responses represent "number of times" as determined by the respondent. </p>
<p><strong>DBD221a, DBD221b, DBD221c, DBD221d,</strong> and <strong>DBD221u </strong>(Type of milk used) </p>
<p>Responses to these questions are collected as &ldquo;code all that apply.&rdquo; A respondent could report more than one type of milk, and all responses were recorded.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>A new question (DBD229) asking the respondent to assess lifetime regular milk drinking status is included in the 2001-2002 dataset. This question also serves as a gate question to follow-up questions (DBD235ae, DBD235be, and DBD235ce). A respondent who reported never being a regular milk drinker was not asked questions on the use of milk when he/she was a child (5-12 years), a teenager (13-17 years), and a young adult (18-35 years). Analysts who wish to combine data from NHANES 1999-2000 with this 2001-2002 dataset need to be aware of the differences in skip patterns for these follow-up questions on milk use during different ages in life and make appropriate edits prior to the analysis. </p>
<p>In 2002, questions on the frequency and type of table salt use were moved from the DBQ section of the household interview to the dietary interview section in the Mobile Examination Center (MEC). For this data release, the 2001 DBQ responses of these questions were combined with the data collected in the 2002 MEC dietary interview, and included as part of the Total Nutrient Intakes File of the Dietary Interview Component (DRXTOT_B). The four-year examination weight (WTMEC4YR) is to be used for combined analyses of NHANES 1999-2000 and NHANES 2001-2002 data on these variables. </p>
<p>A number of questions asked in the DBQ section for 1999-2000 were not continued in this section for 2001-2002. These include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Poultry consumption (yes/no) and poultry skin trim practices (&ge; 12 yr) </li>
    <li>Meat consumption (yes/no) and meat fat trim practices (&ge; 12 yr) </li>
    <li>Alcohol consumption frequency by type of alcohol (&ge; 20 yr) </li>
    <li>Consumption of 5 major food groups by the elderly (&ge; 60 yr) </li>
</ul>
