<p>In 2007, a Flexible Consumer Behavior Survey (FCBS) module was added to the NHANES. This module was developed in collaboration with the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It was designed to collect information on people&rsquo;s knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward nutrition and food choices.</p>
<p>The FCBS module has two elements: a core set of questions asked in the household interview, and a supplementary module asked in a 15-minute telephone follow-up interview with focuses specifically designed for each 2-year data collection cycle.</p>
<p>Data from the core set of questions in the 2009-2010 FCBS module have been included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2009-2010/dbq_f.htm" target="_blank">Diet Behavior (DBQ)</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2009-2010/cbq_f.htm" target="_blank">Consumer Behavior (CBQ)</a> sections and released in separate files available on the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2009" target="_blank">NHANES website</a>.</p>
<p>The FCBS supplementary phone follow-up module was designed to be administered differently depending upon the survey participant&rsquo;s age. For participants aged 16 years and older, we were interested in how their behavior related to their own diet and health. Therefore, the data were collected at person-level, meaning each participant answered the questions for himself/herself.. For children aged 1-15 years old, the research interest was to see how the adults&rsquo; beliefs and behaviors can be related to the intake of children in the family. For example, the fast food buying habits of an adult may relate to the dietary intake of the children in the same family. Therefore, the FCBS phone follow up data were collected at the family level for children 1-15 years old. The questions were asked to one adult respondent in the family, the data were then linked to all eligible children in the home. The adult was not providing a proxy response for the child but giving his/her own information in this interview.</p>
<p>In 2009-2010, the following changes were made to the FCBS supplementary phone follow up module:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Two questions were added to ask respondents the reason(s) they use or do not use food labels. The responses were coded into 22 data items: 12 reasons for using (CBQ738a-CBQ738cd) and 10 reasons for not using (CBQ698a-CBQ698cd) food labels. </li>
    <li>Seven questions (CBQ790-CBQ820) were added to ask about the use of organic foods by food categories. </li>
    <li>One question (CBQ825) was added to ascertain the awareness of the USDA organic seal. </li>
</ol>
<p>Similar to other datasets in the NHANES 2009-2010 release cycle, all FCBS related data files can be linked by the respondent sequence number (SEQN). For more information on the other FCBS related data, refer to the documentations accompanying the datasets.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All NHANES participants aged 1 year and older who complete a dietary interview in the mobile examination center (MEC) are eligible to participate in the FCBS follow-up interview. However, only data from survey participants aged 16 years and older are included in this dataset. Data collected for participants aged 1-15 years are released in a separate dataset (<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2009-2010/cbqpfc_f.htm" target="_blank">CBQPFC_F</a> ).</p><h2 id="Interview_Setting_and_Mode_of_Administration">Interview Setting and Mode of Administration</h2><p>The FCBS follow-up interview was administered to participants aged 16 years and older, over the telephone, after the day 2 dietary interview (Note: The day 2 dietary interviews are conducted by telephone 3-10 days after the health examination in the MEC). After the day 2 dietary interview was completed, participants were given the option to continue with the FCBS interview or have it scheduled for another day or time.</p>
<p>All the questions were asked by trained interviewers using the Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing &ndash; CATI system. A hand card booklet was given to the participants before they left the MEC for them to use later during the follow-up interview. When necessary, the interviewers read the hand cards to respondents.</p><h2 id="Quality_Assurance_&amp;_Quality_Control">Quality Assurance &amp; Quality Control</h2><p>The CATI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data entry errors. CATI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in defining key terms used in the questionnaire. All of the data were reviewed by the NHANES field office staff for accuracy and completeness.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Frequency counts were checked, "skip" patterns were verified, and the reasonableness of question responses was reviewed. Edits were made to some variables to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic usefulness of the data. Edits were also made, when necessary, to address data disclosure concerns. When a variable was modified globally, as part of the editing process, the third letter in the variable name was changed from a Q (i.e., CBQ) to a D (i.e., CBD). For example, some data were collected using two variables (a number variable and a unit of measure variable), but combined into a single variable for data release purposes. </p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Only participants who complete a dietary interview in the MEC are eligible to participate in the FCBS follow-up interview. For the 2009-2010 NHANES, there were 6,399 individuals aged 16 years and older eligible for the FCBS follow-up interview; of these 5,206 were considered respondents for the FCBS.</p>
<p>Most analyses of NHANES data use data collected in the MEC and the variable WTMEC2YR should be used for the sample weights. However, for the FCBS follow-up data, different sample weights are recommended for analysis. The dietary day one sample weight (WTDRD1) is recommended for use in analysis with data from FCBS follow-up module (either alone or when FCBS follow-up data are used in conjunction with MEC data). The set of weights WTDRD1 is applicable to the 5,206 respondents with FCBS follow-up data. Day 1 weights were constructed by taking the MEC sample weights (WTMEC2YR) and further adjusting for (a) the additional non-response and (b) the differential allocation by day of the week for the dietary intake data collection. These Day 1 weights are more variable than the MEC weights, and the sample size is smaller, so estimated standard errors using Day 1 data and Day 1 weights are larger than standard errors for similar estimates based on MEC weights. For more detailed information on the dietary Day 1 weights, refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2009-2010/drxdoc_f.htm" target="_blank">documentations accompanying the dietary datasets</a>.</p>

If the respondent does not know what "whole grains"means, code "66666666".
Use help screen to provide answers to the respondent if he/she wants to know what "whole grains" means. However, do NOT change the original "66666666" code even if the respondent gives an answer after you had explained "whole grains".
HELP SCREEN: 
Whole grains contain the entire grain kernel -- the bran, germ, and endosperm. Examples include: whole-wheat flour, whole-wheat bread, whole-wheat cereal flakes, bulgur (cracked wheat), oatmeal, whole cornmeal, and brown rice.
