        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The Consumer Behavior Phone Follow-up Module &ndash; Child (CBQPFC) section provides interview data for participants 1-15 years old on various dietary related consumer behavior topics at the family level. Topics included in the section are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Use of calorie labels on menus of various types of food-serving establishments (21 questions; CBQ506 - CBQ900);
    </li>
    <li>Use of certain components of the Nutrition Facts Label (17 questions; CBQ700 &ndash; CBQ695); and
    </li>
    <li>Respondent information (7 questions; CBQ755, DBQ930, DBQ935, DBQ940, DBQ945, CBQ760, and CBQ765). </li>
</ul>
<p>In 2007, a Flexible Consumer Behavior Survey (FCBS) module was introduced in NHANES. This module was developed in collaboration with the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It was designed to collect information on people&rsquo;s knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward nutrition and food choices.</p>
<p>The FCBS module has two elements: a core set of questions asked in the household interview, and a supplementary module asked in a 15-minute telephone follow-up interview with focuses specifically designed for each 2-year data collection cycle. While the core questions remained in the survey continuously, the supplementary module was discontinued after 2009-2010 and reinstituted in 2017-2018. </p>
<p>Data from the core set of questions in the 2017-2018 FCBS module have been included in the Diet Behavior and Nutrition (DBQ), Consumer Behavior (CBQ), Income (INQ), and Food Security (FSQ) sections and released in separate files available on the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&amp;CycleBeginYear=2017" target="_blank">NHANES website</a>. </p>
<p>The FCBS supplementary phone follow-up module was designed to be administered differently depending upon the survey participant&rsquo;s age. For participants aged 16 years and older, we were interested in how their behavior related to their own diet and health. Therefore, the data were collected at person-level, meaning each participant answered the questions for himself/herself. For children ages 1-15 years old, the research interest was to see how the adults&rsquo; beliefs and behaviors can be related to the intake of children in the family. For example, the fast food buying habits of an adult may relate to the dietary intake of the children in the same family. Therefore, the FCBS phone follow-up data were collected at the family level for children 1-15 years old. The questions were asked to one adult respondent in the family, the data were then linked to all eligible children in the home. The adult was not providing a proxy response for the child but giving his/her own information in this interview.</p>
<p>To be consistent with the design of the instrument, data from the FCBS supplementary phone follow up module are released in two separate files based on the target groups: one dataset (CBQPFA_J) for survey participants 16 years and older, and another dataset (CBQPFC_J) for participants 1-15 years old.  </p>
<p>
Similar to other datasets in the NHANES 2017-2018 release cycle, all FCBS related data files can be linked by the respondent sequence number (SEQN). For more information on the other FCBS related data, refer to the documentations accompanying the datasets.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All NHANES participants aged 1 year and older who complete a dietary interview in the mobile examination center (MEC) were eligible to participate in the FCBS follow-up interview. However, only data collected for participants aged 1-15 years are included in this dataset. Data from survey participants aged 16 years and older are released in a separate dataset (<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/cbqpfa_j.htm" target="_blank">CBQPFA_J</a>).</p><h2 id="Interview_Setting_and_Mode_of_Administration">Interview Setting and Mode of Administration</h2><p>The FCBS follow-up interview was administered over the telephone after the day 2 dietary interview (Note: The day 2 dietary interviews were conducted by telephone 3-10 days after the health examination in the MEC, but the timing varied). After the day 2 dietary interview was completed for the first child aged 1-15 years in the family, a set of screening questions was asked to identify the family&rsquo;s meal planner and/or food shopper to be the respondent for the FCBS follow-up interview. </p>
<p>All the questions were asked by trained interviewers using the Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing - CATI system. A hand card booklet was given to the participants before they left the MEC for them to use later during the follow-up interview. When necessary, the interviewers read the hand cards to respondents.</p><h2 id="Quality_Assurance_&amp;_Quality_Control">Quality Assurance &amp; Quality Control</h2><p>The CATI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data entry errors. CATI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in defining key terms used in the questionnaire. All of the data were reviewed by NHANES office staff for accuracy and completeness.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Frequency counts were checked, &ldquo;skip&rdquo; patterns were verified, and the reasonableness of question responses was reviewed. Edits were made to some variables to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic usefulness of the data. Edits were also made, when necessary, to address data disclosure concerns. When a variable was modified globally, as part of the editing process, the third letter in the variable name was changed from a Q (i.e., CBQ) to a D (i.e., CBD). For example, some data were collected using two variables (a number variable and a unit of measure variable), but combined into a single variable for data release purposes.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Only participants who complete a day 1 dietary interview in the MEC are eligible to participate in the FCBS follow-up interview. For the 2017-2018 NHANES, there were 2,045 children aged 1-15 years eligible for the FCBS follow-up interview; of these, 1,665 were considered respondents for the FCBS. Dietary day 1 sample weights (WTDRD1) are recommended for use in analysis with data from the FCBS follow-up module (either alone or when the FCBS follow-up data are used in conjunction with MEC data). This set of weights was constructed by taking the MEC sample weights (WTMEC2YR) and further adjusting for (a) the additional non-response and (b) the differential allocation by day of the week for the dietary intake data collection. For more detailed information on the dietary day 1 weights, refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/DR1TOT_J.htm" target="_blank">documentation accompanying the dietary datasets</a>.</p>
<p>The order of the response categories for five questions (CBQ915, CBQ925, CBQ738, CBQ698, and CBQ695) were randomized by household to minimize primacy and recency bias.</p>
