        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p><strong>Ethylene Oxide </strong></p>
<p>Ethylene oxide (EO) is an industrial chemical used to manufacture consumer and non-consumer products and is used as a gaseous sterilant for medical devices. EO has been classified as a human carcinogen (Group 1) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).   EO has been detected in tobacco smoke, automobile exhaust, and some foods (Clin Chem, 2016).  EO is formed endogenously in animals and humans from Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) mediated metabolic oxidation of ethylene. It is also formed in vivo during normal physiological processes, such as methionine oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and during metabolic activity of intestinal bacteria. Information on endogenous and exogenous EO exposure in the general population is very limited and is needed to assess potential health effects associated with this exposure and to monitor changes in exposure over time.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third subsample were
eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>This procedure describes a method based on the modified Edman reaction to measure hemoglobin adducts of EO in human whole blood or erythrocytes. Specifically, the reaction products with the N-terminal valine residue of the hemoglobin protein chains (N-[2-carbamoyl ethyl] valine and N-[2-hydroxycarbamoyl-ethyl] valine EO adducts) are measured.</p>
<p>The modified Edman reaction uses the effect of N-alkylated amino acids to form Edman products in neutral or alkaline conditions versus in acidic conditions required in conventional Edman reaction procedures. It was first described for N-terminal hemoglobin adducts of EO, propylene oxide, and styrene oxide and later optimized to increase yield of Edman products of these adducts. This optimized method was further refined and modified in-house to increase sensitivity and enable automation.<br />
</p>
<p>The procedure described here consists of 4 parts: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Preparation of the specimen for measurement of hemoglobin adducts EO; </li>
    <li>Measurement of total hemoglobin in the sample solution used for hemoglobin
    adduct measurements; </li>
    <li>Modified Edman reaction in the sample solution and isolation of Edman
    products; and </li>
    <li>Analysis of Edman products by high-performance liquid
    chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and results processing. </li>
</ul>
<p>The measurement is achieved using a commercial assay kit based on a well-established procedure commonly used in clinical chemistry. Quantitation of hemoglobin adducts of EO is performed using octapeptides with the same amino acid sequence as the N-terminal of the beta-chain of hemoglobin with EO attached at the valine residue.</p>

stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for
Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA
for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions
are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES
Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM)</a>. Vials are stored under appropriate
frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they are shipped to National Center for Environmental
Health for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality assurance and quality control
protocols (QA/QC) meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates.
Detailed quality control and quality assurance instructions are discussed in
the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</strong></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during MEC visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation, and testing procedures. Each member is observed and given constructive feedback. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical Laboratories</strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all the contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981) when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports describing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were
followed. Reported results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory
Sciences&rsquo; QA/QC performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the
Westgard rules (Caudill et al, 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable
values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015">2015-2016 Laboratory Data Overview</a> for general information on
NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">NHANES Analytic Guidelines</a> and the on-line <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">NHANES Tutorial</a> for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><strong>Subsample Weights</strong></p>
<p>Hemoglobin adducts of EO were measured in a one-third subsample of participants 6 years and
older.&nbsp;Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data. </p>
<p><strong>Demographic and Other Related Variables</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2015">NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics File</a>
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2015-2016/fastqx_i.htm">Fasting
Questionnaire File</a> includes auxiliary information such as fasting
status, the time of venipuncture, and the conditions precluding venipuncture.</p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other
NHANES data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong> </p>
<p>The detection limits were constant for all analytes in the data set. Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending with &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex., LBDEOALC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; indicates that the result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXEOA) provides the analytic result for that analyte. For analytes with results below the lower limit of detection (ex., LBDEOALC =1), an imputed value was provided. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).</p>
<p>The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in pmol/g Hb) for EO is:

<p><sup>1&nbsp;</sup>LLOD was adjusted for a calibrator bias, see section below for details.</p>
<p><strong>Bias adjustments Applied to Hemoglobin Adducts of Ethylene<strong>&nbsp;Oxide</strong> (LBXEOA)</strong><br />
</p>
<p>A systematic bias was discovered for the measurement of hemoglobin adducts of EO in red blood cells in the NHANES 2013 - 2014 and 2015 &ndash; 2016 cycles. The bias was detected after a new batch of calibrators were used after LBXEOA measurements were completed. The calibrators were obtained from a commercial source. Further investigations conducted by the CDC testing laboratory confirmed that the initial calibrator materials did not have the purity specified by the manufacturer. This discrepancy between the anticipated concentration of the calibrators and the actual concentration led to systematic bias in LBXEOA results. The systematic nature of these biases permitted retrospective adjustment through an algebraic correction using a formula.</p>
<p>The lower limit of detection (LLOD) and the measurement values for LBXEOA were initially adjusted in April 2022 and the revised data file released that same month. The formula used to adjust measurements required logarithmic transformation. However, the formula was applied to data that were not uniformly log-transformed, rendering the revised measurement values released in April 2022 invalid.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the LLOD and the measurement values for LBXEOA were correctly adjusted using the following formula , which is based on log-transformed measurement values:<br />
</p>
<p style="margin: 0.25in 0.5in; text-align: center; line-height: 15.95pt;"><em>LBXEOA</em>&nbsp;= 0.58026 (<em>LBXEOA_original&nbsp;</em><sup>1.03562</sup>)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />
<p><sup>1</sup>The derivation of the formula is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">log<sub>10</sub><em>[LBXEOA]</em>&nbsp;= log<sub>10</sub>&nbsp;(<em>LBXEOA_original</em>&nbsp;*1.03562-0.23638)<br />
<em>LBXEOA</em>&nbsp;= 10&nbsp;<sup>log</sup><sub>10</sub><sup>(<em>LBXEOA_original&nbsp;</em>*1.03562-0.23638)</sup><br />
<em>LBXEOA</em>&nbsp;= 0.58026 (<em>LBXEOA_original&nbsp;</em><sup>1.03562</sup>)</p></div>
