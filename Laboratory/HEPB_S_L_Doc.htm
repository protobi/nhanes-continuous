        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Hepatitis viruses
constitute a major public health problem because of the morbidity and mortality
associated with the acute and chronic consequences of these infections. Because
of the high rate of asymptomatic infection with these viruses, information
about the prevalence of these diseases is needed to monitor prevention efforts.
By testing a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population, NHANES
provides the most reliable estimates of age-specific prevalence needed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the strategies to prevent these infections. NHANES testing
for markers of infection with hepatitis viruses is used to determine secular
trends in infection rates across most age and racial/ethnic groups, and provides
a national picture of the epidemiologic determinants of these infections.</p>
<p>Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver most
often caused by a virus. Viral hepatitis is a major public health problem of
global importance because of the ongoing transmission of viruses that cause the
disease and increased morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and
chronic consequences of these infections. Global and U.S. goals have been
established for elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by
2030 (HHS Healthy People, 2022 and HHS 2020). </p>
<p>In the U.S., the most common types of viral hepatitis are hepatitis A, B, and C. Effective vaccines are available to help prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B. No vaccine is available for hepatitis C; however, highly effective, well-tolerated treatment can cure hepatitis C virus infection. Hepatitis D virus infection is less common in the U.S. and can occur only among persons with hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis E infection also is less common in the U.S. These five hepatitis viruses, also called hepatitides, are well-characterized for detection with laboratory assays and are monitored in U.S. public health surveillance systems.</p>
<p>NHANES viral hepatitis data are used to monitor
progress toward goals in <em>Healthy People </em>and the Health and Human
Services (HHS) <em>Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan</em>, which in turn
support U.S. and global viral hepatitis elimination goals (HHS Healthy People,
2022 and National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). The viral hepatitis laboratory and interview components
of NHANES complement data from outbreak, case-based surveillance, vital
statistics, health care systems, and cohort studies that can provide timely,
detailed, or longitudinal information for subnational geographic areas and
disproportionately affected populations, such as people experiencing
homelessness or living in correctional facilities; however, these sources lack
information available from NHANES, such as race, ethnicity, education, income,
and health status and behaviors. </p>
<p>Viral hepatitis data from NHANES are available
beginning with NHANES II conducted in 1976-1980 for hepatitis A and hepatitis
B, and with NHANES III conducted in 1988-1994 for hepatitis C, hepatitis D, and
hepatitis E. </p>
<p>An estimated
300 million people worldwide are persistent carriers of hepatitis B virus
(HBV). Infection with HBV results in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic liver
diseases that may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Transmission
of HBV occurs by percutaneous exposure to blood products and contaminated
instruments, sexual contact and perinatally from HBV-infected mothers to their
unborn child. In 2022, U.S. vaccination guidelines were updated to recommend
hepatitis B vaccination for all infants, unvaccinated children aged &lt;19
years, adults aged 19 through 59 years, and adults aged 60 years and older with
risk factors for hepatitis B.</p>
<p>HBV infection produces an array of unique antigens and antibody
responses that, in general, follow distinct serological patterns.</p>
<p>Testing for hepatitis B surface
antibody contributes information important to distinguish immunity from
vaccination among persons who lack antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen. Assay
results may be used as an aid in the determination of susceptibility to
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for individuals prior to or following HBV
vaccination, or where vaccination status is unknown.</p>
<p>The hepatitis B surface antibody
test is used in NHANES to assess immunity due to vaccination.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined
participants aged 2 years or older were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is measured using the VITROS Anti-HBs Quantitative assay. The test is performed using the VITROS Anti-HBs Quantitative Reagent Pack and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-HBs Calibrators on the VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System.</p>
<p>Refer to the
Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory
methods used.</p>
<p>There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or
lab site for this component in the NHANES August 2021-August 2023 cycle.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Serum specimens were
processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral Hepatitis, National
Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis. </p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2021-2023/manuals/2021-Laboratory-Procedures-508.pdf">NHANES Laboratory Procedure Manual
(LPM)</a>. Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they
were shipped to Division of Viral Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS,
Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2021-2023/manuals/2021-Laboratory-Procedures-508.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs)</strong> </p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical
Laboratories</strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>There are over 800
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of
missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional
re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a>
and the on-line NHANES
<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial</a> for further details on the use of sample weights and other
analytic issues. </p>
<p><strong>Phlebotomy Weights</strong>
</p>
<p>For the August 2021-August 2023 cycle, analysis of nonresponse patterns for the phlebotomy component in the MEC examination revealed differences by age group and race/ethnicity, among other characteristics. For example, approximately 67% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults aged 18 and older provided a blood specimen. Therefore, an additional phlebotomy weight, WTPH2YR, has been included in this data release to address possible nonresponse bias. Participants who are eligible but did not provide a blood specimen have their phlebotomy weight assigned a value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records. The phlebotomy weight should be used for analyses that use variables derived from blood analytes, and is included in all relevant data files.
</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and
Other Related Variables</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The &nbsp;NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2021">August 2021-August 2023 Demographics File</a> contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.</p>
<p>This laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN). </p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong></p>
<p>This data is
qualitative. The use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) isn&rsquo;t applicable.</p></div>
