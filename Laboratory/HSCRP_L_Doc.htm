        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>C-reactive protein
(CRP) is an acute phase protein synthesized in the liver. It is involved in the
activation of complement, enhancement of phagocytosis, and detoxification of
substances released from damaged tissue. It is one of the most sensitive,
though nonspecific, indicators of inflammation. CRP levels may rise within six
hours of an inflammatory stimulus. Measurement of CRP concentrations by this
highly sensitive method is performed primarily to ascertain the level of
cardiovascular disease risk in individuals who have no existing inflammatory conditions.
Increases in CRP concentration are non-specific and should be used in
conjunction with traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary
syndromes.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined
participants aged 1 year and older were eligible. </p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>This is a
two-reagent, immunoturbidimetric system. The specimen is first combined with a
Tris buffer, then incubated. The second reagent (latex particles coated with
mouse anti-human CRP antibodies) is then added. In the presence of circulating
CRP the latex particles aggregate, forming immune complexes. These complexes
cause an increase in light scattering that is proportional to the CRP
concentration. The light absorbance resulting from this light scatter is read
against a stored CRP standard curve. The concentration of CRP is determined
from this line. Turbidity is measured at a primary wavelength of 546 nm
(secondary wavelength 800 nm).</p>
<p>Refer to the Laboratory Method Files
section for a detailed description of the laboratory methods used.</p>
<p>There were no changes
to the lab method or lab site for this component in the NHANES August 2021-August
2023 cycle. During the cycle, the laboratory equipment changed from the Cobas
6000 Analyzer to the Cobas 8000.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

are processed, stored, and shipped to the University of Minnesota &ndash; Advanced
Research Diagnostics Laboratory (ARDL), Minneapolis, MN for analysis. </p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2021-2023/manuals/2021-Laboratory-Procedures-508.pdf">Laboratory
Procedures Manual (LPM)</a>. Vials were
stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they were shipped to
the University of Minnesota for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality
control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are
discussed in the&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2021-2023/manuals/2021-Laboratory-Procedures-508.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</strong></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed
for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing
procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels
were maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical Laboratories</strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods
include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS
developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract laboratories,
which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et. al., 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>There are over 800
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analyst should evaluate the extent of missing data in the
dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables
used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item
non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic Guidelines</a> and the on-line <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">NHANES </a><a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">Tutorial</a> for &nbsp;details on the use of sample weights and other
analytic issues.</p>
<p><strong>Phlebotomy Weights
</strong></p>
<p>For the August 2021-August 2023 cycle, analysis
of nonresponse patterns for the phlebotomy component in the MEC examination
revealed differences by age group and race/ethnicity, among other
characteristics. For example, approximately 67% of children aged 1-17 years who
were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while
95% of examined adults aged 18 and older provided a blood specimen. Therefore,
an additional phlebotomy weight, WTPH2YR, has been included in this data
release to address possible nonresponse bias. Participants who are eligible but did not provide a blood
specimen have their phlebotomy weight assigned a value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records.
The phlebotomy weight should be
used for analyses that use variables derived from blood analytes, and is
included in all relevant data files.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and
Other Related Variables</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2021">NHANES August 2021-August 2023 Demographics
File</a>
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2021-2023/FASTQX_L.htm">Fasting Questionnaire File</a> includes auxiliary
information, such as fasting status, length of fast and the time of
venipuncture.</p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES
data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong></p>
<p>The detection
limit was constant for the analyte in the data set. Two variables are provided
for this analyte. The variable name ending in &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex., LBDHRPLC) indicates
whether the result was below the limit of detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that
the result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the
result was below the limit of detection. For the analyte with analytic results
below the lower limit of detection (LBDHRPLC=1), an imputed fill value was
placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection
divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The variable prefixed LBX
(ex., LBXHSCRP) provides the analytic result for that analyte.</p>
<p>The
lower limit of detection (LLOD, in mg/L) for High-Sensitivity C-Reactive
Protein:</p>

<p><strong>High Sensitivity
C-Reactive Protein (HSCRP) regression equations to compare August 2021-August
2023 and 2017-March 2020 data: </strong></p>
<p>A method
validation (bridging) study was performed to compare results from results from a
laboratory instrument change that occurred during the August 2021&ndash;August 2023
survey cycle. The Cobas 6000 Chemistry Analyzer was upgraded to the Cobas
8000 Chemistry Analyzer during the cycle. Randomly selected serum samples (n=150)
from previously NHANES were measured using both instruments and the results
were used to conduct the analysis. On average, HSCRP values measured with the Cobas
6000 (2017-March 2020 instrument) were 14.28% higher than values measured with the
Cobas 8000 (August 2021-August 2023 instrument) (p = 0.0001). Data from the
bridging study indicated the correlation coefficient (r) between the
measurements was 0.996. Regression analyses were performed using Analyse-it,
v4.30.4. Given
that the data showed proportional differences in variability, a weighted Deming
regression was chosen to describe the relation between the HSCRP results
(mg/dL) from the two
instruments as below:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Forward</span>:&nbsp;Cobas 8000 = -0.08653 + 0.9672 * (Cobas 6000); 95% CI of slope (0.9388
to 0.9956) and intercept (-0.1157 to -0.05737).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Backward</span>: Cobas 6000 = 0.08946 + 1.034 * (Cobas 8000); 95% CI of slope (1.003 to 1.065)
and intercept (0.06146 to 0.1175).</p>
<p>These regression
equations are provided for analytic use and should be applied according to the
analytic aims and interests. The backwards equation can be used to ensure
comparability between the August 2021-August 2023 cycle and previous years that
were measured using the Cobas 6000 Analyzer values (2017-March 2020). The
forward equation may be used if the interest is ensuring comparability with
data collected using the Cobas 8000 Analyzer (August 2021-August 2023 and
later) when comparing or combining the August 2021-August 2023 values with
other years of data. Please note that HSCRP was first measured in the
continuous NHANES in the 2015-2016 cycle, and it was not measured with the Cobas
6000 Analyzer then. For analysis involving 2015-2016 data, please refer to the
documentation accompanying the 2017-2018 data (<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/HSCRP_J.htm">HSCRP_J</a>) for
additional adjustments.</p></div>
