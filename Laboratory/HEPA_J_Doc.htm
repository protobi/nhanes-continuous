        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Hepatitis viruses
constitute a major public health problem because of the morbidity and mortality
associated with the acute and chronic consequences of these infections. New
immunization strategies have been developed to eliminate the spread of the
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the United States.
Recommendations have also been developed for the prevention and control of the
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Because of the high rate of asymptomatic
infection with these viruses, information about the prevalence of these
diseases is needed to monitor prevention efforts. By testing a nationally
representative sample of the U.S. population, NHANES will provide the most
reliable estimates of age-specific prevalence needed to evaluate the
effectiveness of the strategies to prevent these infections. In addition,
NHANES provides the means to better define the epidemiology of other hepatitis
viruses. NHANES testing for markers of infection with hepatitis viruses will be
used to determine secular trends in infection rates across most age and
racial/ethnic groups, and will provide a national picture of the epidemiologic
determinants of these infections.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Examined
participants aged 2 years and older were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The VITROS
Anti-HAV Total assay is performed using the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products
Anti-HAV Total Reagent Pack and the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-HAV
Total Calibrator on the VITROS ECi/ECiQ or VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">A competitive
immunoassay technique is used, which involves pre-incubation of anti-HAV in the
sample with HAV antigen in the assay reagent, followed by incubation with a
conjugate reagent that contains biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-HAV antibody
and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-HAV antibody.
The immune complex is captured by streptavidin on the wells. Unbound materials
are removed by washing. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The bound HRP
conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing
luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an
electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate
catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The
electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of
light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the
VITROS ECi/ECiQ or VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System. The binding of HRP is
indicative of the absence of anti-HAV antibody. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Refer to the
Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory
methods used. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">There were no
changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this component in the
NHANES 2017-2018 cycle.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Serum specimens were
processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral Hepatitis, National
Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES
Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM)</a>. Vials were stored
under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they were shipped to Division
of Viral Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB
Prevention for testing.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;"><b>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs)</b> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-control
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;"><b>Analytical
Laboratories</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.
</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018 Laboratory Data Overview</a> for general
information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic
Guidelines </a>and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial </a>for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic
issues. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;"><b>Demographic and
Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2017">NHANES 2017-2018
Demographics File</a> contains demographic data, health indicators, and
other related information collected during household interviews as well as the
sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation
requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively)
in the demographic data file.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">This laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN). </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;"><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The assay used in
this study cannot differentiate between natural infection and vaccination;
therefore, seropositivity for anti-HAV reflects either natural or
vaccine-induced immunity.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">This data is
qualitative. The use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not applicable.
