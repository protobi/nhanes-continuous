        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program suspended field
operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not
completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore,
data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES
2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March
2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to
the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>The specific aims
of the component are: 1) to measure the prevalence and extent of tobacco use;
2) to estimate the extent of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), and
determine trends in exposure to ETS; and 3) to describe the relationship
between tobacco use (as well as exposure to ETS) and chronic health conditions,
including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>Cotinine and
trans-3&rsquo;-hydroxycotinine (hydroxycotinine) are the primary metabolites of
nicotine. The concentrations of cotinine and hydroxycotinine in body fluids can
be used as markers for active smoking and as indices for secondhand smoke (SHS)
exposure. Because their concentrations are greater and their elimination
half-lives significantly longer, these metabolites are generally preferred over
nicotine itself as biomarkers. Cotinine, the primary proximal metabolite of
nicotine, is generally regarded as the marker of choice. The estimated
elimination half-life of cotinine is about 15-20 hours; by contrast, the
half-life of nicotine is only 0.5-3 hours. The half-life of hydroxycotinine is
approximately 5-6 hours, but when hydroxycotinine is generated from cotinine,
its elimination half-life becomes similar to that of cotinine. </p>
<p>Cotinine and
hydroxycotinine can be measured in serum, urine, and salivaâ€•the half-life of
cotinine in all three fluids is essentially the same. Cotinine concentrations
tend to be three to eight times higher in urine than in serum; however, plasma
or serum is the fluid of choice for studies requiring a quantitative assessment
of exposure. For that reason, serum was chosen as the matrix for the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cotinine analyses. In serum,
hydroxycotinine concentrations tend to be two to four times lower than cotinine
concentrations.</p>
<p>The tobacco
component for NHANES also included questionnaire items on current and past use
of cigarettes, pipes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco. Questions were asked
regarding exposure to ETS at home, at work, and in utero among children. In
addition, use of nicotine replacement products (e.g., gum and patch) was
collected using questionnaires.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined participants aged 3 years and older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>Serum cotinine
and hydroxycotinine are measured by an isotope-dilution high-performance liquid
chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass
spectrometric (ID HPLC-APCI MS/MS) method. Briefly, the serum sample is spiked
with methyl-D3-cotinine and methyl-D3-hydroxycotinine as internal standards.
The sample is basified and then applied to a supported liquid extraction (SLE)
plate. The analytes are extracted with an isopropanol/methylene chloride
mixture, the organic extract is concentrated, and the residue is injected onto
a C18 HPLC column. The eluent from these injections is monitored by APCI-MS/MS.
The m/z 80 product ion from the m/z 177 quasi-molecular ion is measured for
cotinine and the m/z 80 product ion from the m/z 193 quasi-molecular ion is
measured for hydroxycotinine. Additional ions for the internal standards and
for confirmation are also monitored for the respective compounds. Analyte
concentrations are derived from the area ratios of native-to-labeled compounds
in the sample by comparisons to a standard curve.</p>

specimens&nbsp;are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, and Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis. </p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf" target="_blank">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf" target="_blank">2019-2020 Laboratory Procedures Manuals (LPMs)</a>.
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;20&deg;C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES
quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are
discussed in the&nbsp;NHANES
LPM.</p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-control
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback
are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted
annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained. </p>
<p><b>Analytical Laboratories </b></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the contract
laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split samples
collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories randomly
perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed
and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures
recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported results for all assays
meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo; quality control and quality assurance
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al., 2008). </p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic required
suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020 after data were
collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020 sample. Data
collection was cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because the collected
data from 18 locations were not nationally representative, these data were
combined with data from the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a 2017-March
2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process was applied to the
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in the
present file should be used to calculate estimates from the combined cycles.
These sample weights are not appropriate for independent analyses of the
2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative results for either
the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the
NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific
weights for that 2-year cycle.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017" target="_blank">2017-2018 </a>and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019" target="_blank">2019-2020 Laboratory Data Overview</a> for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory
tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided
biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. The specimen
availability can also vary by age or other population characteristics. For
example, in 2017-March 2020 approximately 76% of children aged 1-17 years who
were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while
95% of examined adults aged 18 and older provided a blood specimen. Analysts
should evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the
outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to
determine whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a>&nbsp;and the on-line
NHANES&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial</a>
for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Sample Weights</b></p>
<p>Exam sample
weights should be used for analyses.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020">NHANES
2017-March 2020 Demographics File</a> contains demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews
as well as the sample weight variables. The recommended procedure for variance
estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU,
respectively) in the demographic data file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm">Fasting Questionnaire File</a>
includes auxiliary information such as fasting status, the length of fast, and
the time of venipuncture.</p>
<p>The laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>The detection
limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two variables are
provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex.,
LBDCOTLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection: the
value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo;
indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For analytes with
analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex. LBDCOTLC =1), an
imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the
lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The
other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXCOT) provides the analytic result for the
analyte. </p>

detection (LLOD in ng/mL) for Cotinine and Hydroxycotinine in serum: </p>
