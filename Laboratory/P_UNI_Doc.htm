        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.

<p><strong>Nickel
</strong></p>
<p>Nickel is a very hard metal that occurs naturally in soils and volcanic dust (ATSDR, 2005).  The essentiality of nickel has not been proven in humans, though it has been for animal studies, while toxicity in humans has been documented. Nickel can be introduced into the human body via consumption of plants or supplements, degradation of metal-on-metal implants, and industrial exposure.  Contact with nickel can cause allergic skin reactions; inhalation of nickel has been found to lead to asthma, chronic bronchitis, and lung cancer; drinking water containing high levels of nickel has been found to cause stomach, blood, and kidney issues.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third subsample of examined participants aged 6 years and older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>
This method (Jones, 2021) directly measures the nickel, arsenic, and chromium content of urine specimens using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after a simple dilution sample preparation step. Liquid samples are reduced to small droplets in an argon aerosol via a nebulizer, and then the droplets enter the ICP where the thermal energy atomizes the sample and then ionizes the atoms. The ions are pulled into the mass spectrometer where they are focused through the universal cell technology (UCT), the quadrupole mass filter, and finally are selectively counted in rapid sequence at the detector according to their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio. When detecting nickel, the UCT is filled with helium gas and operated in a kinetic energy discrimination (KED) mode to eliminate polyatomic interferences. Quantification of nickel is accomplished by comparing the blank-subtracted counting rate of nickel from a sample, ratioed to an internal standard, to the counting rate, ratioed to an internal standard, of blank-subtracted, matrix-matched, external calibrators, tested within the same analytical run.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Urine samples are
processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National
Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, GA for analysis. </p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf">2019-2020</a> NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manuals (LPMs). Vials are stored
under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they are shipped to National
Center for Environmental Health for testing. </p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are
discussed in the NHANES LPMs. </p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs) </strong></p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained. </p>
<p><strong>Analytical
Laboratories </strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens. </p>
<p>NCHS developed and
distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined
the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981) when running NHANES specimens.
Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt
of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument
calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS
quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The
laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern. </p>
<p>All QC procedures
recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported results for all assays
meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo; QA/QC criteria for accuracy and
precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al, 2008). </p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in the demographic data file should be used to calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle. </p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019">2019-2020 Laboratory Data Overview</a>
documents for general information on NHANES laboratory data. </p>
<p>There are over 800
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of
missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional
re-weighting for item non-response is necessary. </p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a>
and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial</a> for further details on the use of sample weights and
other analytic issues.</p>
<p><strong>Subsample Weights </strong><br />
</p>
<p>The analytes included in this dataset were measured in all examined participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Variable (WTSAPRP) encoding of the specific sample weights for this subsample is included in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data. These special sample weights were created to account for the subsample selection probability, as well as the additional nonresponse to these lab tests. Therefore, if participants were eligible for the subsample, but did not provide a urine specimen, they would have the sample weight value assigned as &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records.</p>
<p>
<strong>Demographic and Other Related Variables </strong></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design and
demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020">NHANES 2017- March 2020 Pre-Pandemic Demographics File</a>&nbsp;contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file. <br />
<br />
This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p>
The variable URXUCR (urine creatinine) will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled Albumin&nbsp;&amp; Creatinine &ndash; Urine. </p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits </strong></p>
<p>The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex., URDUNILC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection: &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXUNI) provides the analytic result for that analyte.  For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex., URDUNILC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). </p>
<p>The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in &micro;g/L) for urinary nickel is:&nbsp;</p>
