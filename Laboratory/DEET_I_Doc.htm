        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide, commonly
known as DEET, has become a widely used insect repellent in the United States.
DEET is highly effective against a broad spectrum of insect pests, including
potential disease vectors, such as mosquitoes, biting flies, and ticks (CDC,
2015). More than 500 products are currently registered with the Environmental
Protection Agency in a variety of liquids, lotions, gels, sprays, sticks, and
impregnated materials with DEET concentrations ranging from 5 to 98% (EPA,
2017). Every year, approximately one-third of the U.S. population uses
DEET-containing insect repellents (CDC, 2009), and exposure to DEET is
widespread (Calafat et al., 2016). Urinary metabolites of DEET are more
sensitive biomarkers of exposure than DEET itself; in fact, relying on DEET as an
exposure biomarker can lead to exposure misclassification (Calafat et al., 2016;
ATSDR, 2017).</p>
<p>To better understand exposure to DEET, a surplus project testing 3-(Ethylcarbamoyl)benzoic acid (ug/L) was also performed in a one-third subsample of participants 3+ years of age from NHANES 2015-2016 (SSDEET_I), in addition to the one measured DEET metabolite in this dataset (3-(diethylcarbamoyl)benzoic acid).</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined
participants aged 3 to 5 years were eligible and participants aged 6 years and
older from a one-third subsample were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>The method uses 0.2 mL of urine for quantifying two DEET metabolites: 3-(diethylcarbamoyl)benzoic acid and 3-(ethylcarbamoyl)benzoic acid; four neonicotinoid insecticides: acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiacloprid; and two neonicotinoid metabolites: N-desmethyl-acetamiprid and 5-hydroxy-imidaclopridand. The method is based on enzymatic hydrolysis of urinary conjugates of the target analytes, online solid phase extraction, reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography separation, and isotope dilution-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry detection (Baker et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Refer to the
Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory methods
used. <br />
<br />
There were no changes to the lab equipment or lab site for this component in
the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle. However, the lab method was changed to include
neonicotinoid insecticide biomarkers, and one additional DEET metabolite. These
data can be found in the Neonicotinoids

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Urine specimens
are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory Sciences,
National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis. <br />
<br />
Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the
<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES
Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM)</a>. Vials were stored under
appropriate frozen (-30&deg;C) conditions until they were shipped to National
Center for Environmental Health for testing. <br />
<br />
The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>.</p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is
monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a
structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the
quality of the laboratory work and the quality-control procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen collection
and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are given to each
staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that
required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed
and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard
rules (Westgard et al, 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports
containing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens,
summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration,
reagents, and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The
reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are
required to explain any identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC
procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported results for
all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo; quality control and
quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to
the Westgard rules (Caudill et al., 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015">2015-2016
Laboratory Data Overview</a> for general information on NHANES
laboratory data.</p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic
Guidelines</a> and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/">Tutorial</a> for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Subsample weights</b></p>
<p>DEET and
metabolites were measured in a full sample of participants ages 3-5 and a one-third subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special sample
weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights
for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used when
analyzing these data.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/DEMO_I.XPT">NHANES Demographic
Data File</a> contains demographic data, health indicators, and other
related information collected during household interviews as well as the sample
design variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires
use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.</p>
<p>This laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>The detection
limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two variables are
provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex.,
URDDEALC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection: the
value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo;
indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other variable
prefixed URX (ex., URXDEA) provides the analytic result for that analyte. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (i.e., URDDEALC=1),
an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is
the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]).</p>
<p>The lower limit
of detection (LLOD in ng/mL) for DEET
metabolite is: </p>
