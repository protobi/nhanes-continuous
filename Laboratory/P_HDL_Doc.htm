        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program
suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020
cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from
2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to
form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic
data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic
Notes section for more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>Heart disease is
the leading cause of death in the United States (Murphy, et. al., 2018). Blood
lipid levels are fundamental measures included in NHANES that can be used for
cardiovascular risk assessment. The goals of the NHANES blood lipid
measurements include: 1) monitoring the prevalence and trends in major
cardiovascular conditions and overall risk factors in the U.S.; 2) evaluating
prevention and treatment programs targeting cardiovascular disease in the U.S.;
and 3) monitoring the status of hyperlipidemia.</p>
<p>In 2018, new Blood
Cholesterol Guidelines were released, by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Task Force on
Clinical Practice Guidelines, which aim to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease through cholesterol management (Grundy, et. al., 2018).
The blood lipids measurements in NHANES include
total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoproteins
cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides. The present file provides data on the HDL-C.
Data on total cholesterol are provided in the Cholesterol - Total P_TCHOL) file, and LDL-C and triglyceride data are
provided in (P_TRIGLY). </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All
examined participants 6 years and older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic sample were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p><b>High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) </b></p>
<p>This method to
measure HDL-C uses a magnesium/dextran sulfate solution that is first added to
the specimen to form water-soluble complexes with non-HDL cholesterol
fractions. These complexes are not reactive with the measuring reagents added
in the second step. With addition of reagent 2, HDL-cholesterol esters are
converted to HDL-cholesterol by PEG-cholesterol esterase. The HDL-cholesterol
is acted upon by PEG-cholesterol oxidase, and the hydrogen peroxide produced
from this reaction combines with 4-amino-antipyrine and HSDA under the action
of peroxidase to form a purple/blue pigment that is measured photometrically at
600 nm (secondary wavelength = 700 nm). When the cholesterol measuring enzymes
are modified with PEG, they are preferentially more reactive with
HDL-cholesterol than the other cholesterol fractions. This is an endpoint
reaction that is specific for HDL-cholesterol. This 3rd generation method
differs from 2nd generation assays in the type of buffer used in the reagents,
and the concentration of the reagent components. The basic reaction principle
is unchanged. </p>
<p>Refer to the
Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory
methods used.</p>
<p>Serum HDL-C levels were
calculated from directly measured values of total cholesterol, triglycerides,
and LDL-C. Please see below the Data Processing and
Editing section for more details. For laboratory methods used for total
cholesterol and LDL-C and triglycerides, please refer to the accompanying
documentation: <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2020/p_tchol.htm" target="_blank">P_TCHOL </a>and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2020/p_trigly.htm" target="_blank">P_TRIGLY</a>.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Serum specimens
were processed, stored, and shipped to the University of Minnesota,
Minneapolis, MN for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf" target="_blank">2017-2018 </a>and<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf" target="_blank"> 2019-2020 Laboratory Procedures Manuals</a>&nbsp;(LPM). Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C)
conditions until they are shipped to University of Minnesota for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the NHANES LPM.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs)</strong></p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical
Laboratories </strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and
distributed a QC protocol for all the contract laboratories, which outlined the
use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981) when testing NHANES specimens.
Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt
of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument
calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS
quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The
laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p>
<p>One derived
variable was created in this data file. The variable was created using the
following formula:</p>
<p><b>LBDHDDSI</b></p>
<p>HDL-cholesterol in
mg/dL (LBXHDD) was converted to mmol/L (LBDHDDSI) by multiplying by 0.02586. </p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field
operations in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey
locations in the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the
remaining 12 locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not
nationally representative, these data were combined with data from the previous
cycle (2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the demographic data file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not
appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield
nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the
2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional
information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the
previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year
cycle. </p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017" target="_blank">2017-2018 </a>and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019" target="_blank">2019-2020 Laboratory Data Overview </a>documents for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over
800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. For example, in 2017-March 2020, approximately 76% of children aged
1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through
phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older provided a blood
specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset
related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables used in
the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item non-response
is necessary. </p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic
Guidelines</a> and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial</a> for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic
issues.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and
Other Related Variables</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020" target="_blank">2017-March 2020 Pre-Pandemic Demographics File</a><a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2019" target="_blank"> </a>contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables
(SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm" target="_blank">Fasting Questionnaire File </a>includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast and the time of
venipuncture.</p>
<p>This laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
