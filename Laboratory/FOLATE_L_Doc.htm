        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Folate belongs to the group of water-soluble B vitamins
that occur naturally in food. It is required in cellular one carbon metabolism
and hematopoiesis. Prolonged folate deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia (Bailey, 2015).
Low folate status has been shown to increase the risk of women of childbearing
age to have an offspring with neural tube defects. Low folate status also
increases plasma homocysteine levels, a potential risk factor for
cardiovascular disease, in the general population. Potential roles of folate and
other B vitamins in modulating the risk for diseases (e.g., heart disease,
cancer, and cognitive impairment) are currently being studied. </p>
<p>The measurement of total folate (TFOL) provides
information on the folate status of the individual. Serum folate is an
indicator of short-term status, while red blood cell (RBC) folate is an
indicator of long-term status. These data will be used to estimate deficiencies
and toxicities of specific nutrients in the population and subgroup, to provide
population reference data, and to estimate the contribution of diet,
supplements, and other factors to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used
in research to further define nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels
for disease prevention and health promotion. </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined participants
aged 1 year and older were
eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>Population folate
status in the NHANES August 2021&ndash;August 2023 survey cycle was assessed by a
combination of two analytical methods: whole-blood folate was measured by
microbiologic assay, while serum folate forms were measured by isotope-dilution
high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS), this is the same method used in NHANES 2011-March 2020. RBC folate
was then calculated using the data from both assays. </p>
<p><strong>Whole Blood Folate
</strong></p>
<p>Microbiological
assays have been used for many years to estimate the concentration of folate in
blood and other tissues. In the 1990s, more robust and reliable procedures were
developed that use microtiter plates for higher throughput and a cryopreserved
antibiotic resistant microorganism to avoid having to work under aseptic
conditions. The described procedure is an adaptation of this method and was
introduced by the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) to NHANES in
2007. Diluted whole blood is added to an assay medium containing Lactobacillus
rhamnosus (formerly known as Lactobacillus casei) (NCIB 10463) and all of the
nutrients necessary for the growth of L. rhamnosus except folate. The
inoculated medium is incubated for 42 hours at 37<sup>o</sup>C. Since the
growth of L. rhamnosus is proportional to the amount of total folate present in
whole blood sample; the folate level can be assessed by measuring the turbidity
of the inoculated medium at 590 nm in a PowerWave X340 Microplate reader
(Bio-Tek Instrument). The assay was calibrated with 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate
from Merck Cie (Eprova). </p>
<p><strong>Serum Total Folate
</strong></p>
<p>Serum total folate
was calculated as the sum of individual folate forms. Five folate forms,
5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, folic acid, 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate,
tetrahydrofolate, and 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate are measured by
isotope-dilution high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Fazili, et. al., 2013). The assay is performed by
combining specimen (150 &micro;L serum) with an ammonium formate buffer and an
internal standard mixture. Sample extraction and clean-up is performed by
automated 96-probe solid phase extraction (SPE) using 96-well phenyl SPE plates
and takes ~1 h for a 96-well plate. Folate forms are separated within 6 min
using isocratic mobile phase conditions and measured by LC-MS/MS. Quantitation
is based on peak area ratios interpolated against a five-point aqueous linear
calibration curve using 1/x2 weighting. </p>

Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description on the laboratory
methods used. </p>
<p>There
were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab for this component during

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Whole blood and
blood serum are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis. </p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2021-2023/manuals/2021-Laboratory-Procedures-508.pdf">Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)</a>. Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions
until they are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.
</p>
<p>
The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2021-2023/manuals/2021-Laboratory-Procedures-508.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs) </strong></p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured QA evaluation during unscheduled visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained. </p>
<p><strong>Analytical
Laboratories </strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens. </p>
<p>NCHS developed and
distributed a QC protocol for all the contract laboratories, which outlined the
use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et. al., 1981) when testing NHANES specimens.
Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt
of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument
calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS
quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The
laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern. </p>
<p>All QC
procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported results for
all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo; QA/QC performance criteria
for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et. al.,
2008).&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p>
<p>One variable was created
in this data file. The variable (LBDRFO) was created using the following
formula:</p>
<p><strong>LBDRFO:</strong> The RBC folate value in nmol/L RBC (LBDRFOSI) was converted to ng/mL RBC
(LBDRFO) by dividing LBDRFOSI by 2.265 (rounded to 3 significant figures).</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Red blood cell
(RBC) folate in NHANES August 2021 &ndash; August 2023 was calculated from the whole
blood folate concentration as measured by microbiologic assay by adjusting for
RBC volume and correcting for serum total folate concentration, which was
calculated as the sum of individual folate forms. The amounts of individual
serum folate forms were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For folate forms with results lower than limit of
detection (LOD), an imputed value of LOD divided by the square root of 2 was
used. Serum folate forms used to calculate serum total folate concentration
were: 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, folic acid, 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate,
tetrahydrofolate, and 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate.&nbsp;For more detailed
information regarding folate forms data in NHANES August 2021&mdash;August 2023,
please refer to the documentation accompanying the Folate Forms &ndash; Serum (<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2021-2022/FOLFMS_L.htm">FOLFMS_L</a>) file.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a> and the on-line <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">NHANES Tutorial</a> for details
on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><strong>Phlebotomy Weights</strong> <br />
<br />
For the August 2021-August 2023 cycle, analysis of nonresponse patterns for the phlebotomy component in the MEC examination revealed differences by age group and race/ethnicity, among other characteristics. For example, approximately 67% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults aged 18 and older provided a blood specimen. Therefore, an additional phlebotomy weight, WTPH2YR, has been included in this data release to address possible nonresponse bias. Participants who are eligible but did not provide a blood specimen have their phlebotomy weight assigned a value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records. The phlebotomy weight should be used for analyses that use variables derived from blood analytes, and is included in all relevant data files.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and
Other Related Variables </strong></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2021">August
2021&mdash;August 2023 Demographics File </a>contains demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews
as well as the sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance
estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU,
respectively) in the demographic data file. </p>
<p>The<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2021-2022/FASTQX_L.htm"> Fasting Questionnaire
File</a> includes auxiliary information, such as fasting status, the time of
venipuncture, and the conditions precluding venipuncture. </p>
<p>This laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN). </p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits </strong></p>
<p>An exact lower
limit of detection (LLOD) for RBC folate cannot be calculated because the value
is a composite of whole blood folate, serum folate, and hematocrit. Therefore,
there is no LLOD for the calculated value of RBC folate. Furthermore, the LOD
of this method for whole blood folate depends on the dilution factor (i.e., LOD
= 44 nmol/L whole blood if whole blood hemolysate is only diluted 1/40;
assuming a hematocrit of 40%, this would correspond to a RBC folate
concentration of 110 nmol/L RBC). </p></div>
