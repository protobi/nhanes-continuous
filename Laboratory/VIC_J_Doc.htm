        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Vitamin C
(ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin, which has very low toxicity.&nbsp; It is recommended for the prevention and
treatment of scurvy, which is uncommon in the United States (U.S). In excess,
vitamin C has shown to cause diarrhea and kidney stones.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The objectives of
this component are: 1) to provide data for monitoring secular trends in
measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 2) to evaluate the
effect of people's habits and behaviors such as physical activity and the use
of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on people's nutritional status;
and &nbsp;3) to evaluate the effect of changes
in nutrition and public health policies including welfare reform legislation,
food fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status
of the U.S. population. </p>
<p>These data will be
used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific nutrients in the
population and subgroups, to provide population reference data, and to estimate
the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors to serum levels of
nutrients. Data will be used for research to further define nutrient
requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and health
promotion.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined participants
aged 6 years and older were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in serum is measured using
isocratic ultra‐high performance liquid</p>
<p>chromatography (UPLC) with electrochemical detection at
450 mV (range 200 nA). One-part serum is mixed with four parts 6%
metaphosphoric acid (MPA) to acidify the serum and stabilize ascorbate. The specimen
is frozen at ‐70 &deg;C until analysis. After the specimen is thawed at room
temperature and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm, the supernatant is decanted. This
supernatant is mixed with a solution containing trisodium phosphate and
dithiothreitol (to reduce dehydroascorbate to ascorbate) and an internal
standard (1‐methyl uric acid) to reduce dehydroascorbate to
ascorbate. It is re‐acidified with 40% MPA to stabilize the ascorbate. The
sample is filtered to remove insoluble material. A 4 &mu;L aliquot is injected
onto a C‐18 reversed‐phase column and eluted with a mobile phase containing
14.1 g/L monochloroacetic acid, 0.76 g/L disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate,
1% (by volume) 10 N sodium hydroxide, and 1.5% (by volume) methanol, adjusted
to pH 3.00 &plusmn; 0.03 with 10 N sodium hydroxide.&nbsp;
Quantitation is accomplished by comparing the peak area of vitamin C in
the unknown with the peak area of a known amount in a calibrator solution.
Calculations are corrected based on the peak area of the internal standard in
the unknown compared with the peak area of the internal standard in the calibrator
solution.</p>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Serum specimens
were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory Sciences,
National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed instructions
on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)</a>. Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions
until they are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>. </p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed
for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing
procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels
were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods
include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.
1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were
followed. Reported results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo;
QA/QC performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al. 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to
the performing laboratory for confirmation.<br />
<br />
One variable was created in this data file. The variable LBDVICSI was created
using the formula: </p>
<p>
<b>LBDVICSI</b>: The vitamin C value in mg/dL
(LBXVIC) was converted to umol/L (LBDVICSI) by multiplying LBXVIC by 56.78 (rounded
to 3 significant figures). </p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018 Laboratory Data Overview</a>
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over
800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the
tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80%
of children aged
1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through
phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older provided a blood
specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset
related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables used in
the analyses to determine whether&nbsp;additional
re-weighting for item non-response is necessary. </p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a> and the on-line <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">NHANES Tutorial</a> for details
on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2017">NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics File</a>
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/fastqx_j.htm">Fasting
Questionnaire File</a> includes auxiliary information, such as fasting
status, length of fast, and the time of venipuncture. </p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES
data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>The
detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending &ldquo;LC&rdquo;
(ex., LBDVICLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection:
the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo;
indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed
LBX (ex., LBXVIC) provides the analytic result for that analyte.&nbsp; For analytes with analytic
results below the lower limit of detection (ex., LBDVICLC=1),
an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the
lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). </p>
<p>The lower limit of detection (LLOD in mg/dL)&nbsp;for LBXVIC:&nbsp;<i>
