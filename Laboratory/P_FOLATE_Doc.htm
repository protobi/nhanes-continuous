        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program suspended field operations in
March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a
result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and
the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore,
data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES
2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March
2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to
the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>The objectives of the folate component are to: 1) provide
data for monitoring secular trends in measures of nutritional status in the
U.S. population; 2) evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors, such
as physical activity and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements
on nutritional status; and 3) evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and
public health policies, including welfare reform legislation, food
fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status of
the U.S. population. Total folate measurement
provides information on the folate status of the individual, where serum folate
is an indicator of short-term status and red blood cell (RBC) folate is an
indicator of long-term status.</p>
<p>These data will be
used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific nutrients in the
population and subgroup, to provide population reference data, and to estimate
the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors to serum levels of
nutrients. Data will be used in research to further define nutrient
requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and health
promotion. </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined female
participants aged 12-49 years, and other
examined participants (all males as well as females 1-11 years and 50+ years)
one year and older from a one-half subsample in the NHANES 2017-March
2020 pre-pandemic sample
were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>Population folate
status in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 survey cycle was assessed by a combination
of two analytical methods: whole-blood folate was measured by microbiologic
assay, while serum folate forms were measured by isotope-dilution high
performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS), this is the same method used in NHANES 2011-2016. RBC folate was
then calculated using the data from both assays. </p>
<p><strong>Whole Blood Folate
</strong></p>
<p>Microbiological
assays have been used for many years to estimate the concentration of folate in
blood and other tissues. In the 1990s, more robust and reliable procedures were
developed that use microtiter plates for higher throughput and a cryopreserved
antibiotic resistant microorganism to avoid having to work under aseptic
conditions. The described procedure is an adaptation of this method, and was
introduced by the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) to NHANES in
2007. Diluted whole blood is added to an assay medium containing Lactobacillus
rhamnosus (formerly known as Lactobacillus casei) (NCIB 10463) and all of the
nutrients necessary for the growth of L. rhamnosus except folate. The
inoculated medium is incubated for 45 hours at 37<sup>o</sup>C. Since the
growth of L. rhamnosus is proportional to the amount of total folate present in
whole blood sample; the folate level can be assessed by measuring the turbidity
of the inoculated medium at 590 nm in a PowerWave X340 Microplate reader
(Bio-Tek Instrument). The assay was calibrated with 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate
from Merck Cie (Eprova). </p>
<p><strong>Serum Total Folate
</strong></p>
<p>Serum total folate
was calculated as the sum of individual folate forms. Five folate forms,
5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, folic acid, 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate,
tetrahydrofolate, and 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate are measured by
isotope-dilution high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Fazili, et al. 2013). The assay is performed by
combining specimen (150 &micro;L serum) with an ammonium formate buffer and an
internal standard mixture. Sample extraction and clean-up is performed by
automated 96-probe solid phase extraction (SPE) using 96-well phenyl SPE plates
and takes ~1 h for a 96-well plate. Folate forms are separated within 6 min
using isocratic mobile phase conditions and measured by LC-MS/MS. Quantitation
is based on peak area ratios interpolated against a five-point aqueous linear
calibration curve using 1/x2 weighting. </p>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Whole blood and
blood serum are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis. </p>
<p>Detailed instructions
on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf" target="_blank">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf" target="_blank">2019-2020 NHANES Laboratory
Procedures Manuals (LPMs)</a>. Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C)
conditions until they are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health
for testing. </p>
<p>The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES LPMs.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs) </strong></p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured QA evaluation during unscheduled visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained. </p>
<p><strong>Analytical
Laboratories </strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens. </p>
<p>NCHS developed and
distributed a QC protocol for all the contract laboratories, which outlined the
use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981) when running NHANES specimens.
Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt
of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument
calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS
quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The
laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern. </p>
<p>All QC procedures
recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported results for all assays
meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo; QA/QC performance criteria for
accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al. 2008). </p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p>
<p>One variable was
created in this data file. The variable (LBDRFO) was created using the
following formula:</p>
<p><strong>LBDRFO:</strong> The RBC folate value in nmol/L RBC (LBDRFOSI) was converted to ng/mL RBC
(LBDRFO) by dividing LBDRFOSI by 2.265 (rounded to 3 significant figures).</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of
NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020 after data were collected in 18
of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was
cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because the collected data from 18
locations were not nationally representative, these data were combined with
data from the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process was applied to the
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in the
demographic data file should be used to calculate estimates from the combined
cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate for independent analyses of
the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative results for
either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer
to the NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with
specific weights for that 2-year cycle. </p>
<p>Red blood cell
(RBC) folate in NHANES 2017-Mar 2020 was calculated from the whole blood folate
concentration as measured by microbiologic assay by adjusting for RBC volume
and correcting for serum total folate concentration, which was calculated as
the sum of individual folate forms. The amounts of individual serum folate
forms were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS). For folate forms with results lower than limit of detection (LOD),
an imputed value of LOD divided by the square root of 2 was used. Serum folate
forms used to calculate serum total folate concentration were:
5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, folic acid, 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate,
tetrahydrofolate, and 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate.&nbsp;For more detailed
information regarding folate forms data in NHANES 2017- March 2020, please
refer to the documentation accompanying the Folate Forms &ndash; Serum (<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FOLFMS.htm" target="_blank">P_FOLFMS</a>)
file.</p>

for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. For example, in 2017-March
2020 approximately 76% of children aged 1-17
years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through
phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older provided a blood
specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in
the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for
item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to
the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">NHANES
Analytic Guidelines</a> and the on-line <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">NHANES Tutorial</a> for&nbsp;details on
the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. </p>
<p><strong>Subsample Weights</strong></p>
<p>The analytes included in this dataset were measured in
all examined female participants aged 12-49 years, and in a one-half subsample
of other examined participants one year and older. Special sample weights are
required to analyze these data properly. Variable (WTFOLPRP) encoding of the
specific sample weights for this subsample is included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data. These special sample weights were
created to account for the subsample selection probability, as well as the
additional nonresponse to these lab tests. Therefore, if participants were
eligible for the subsample, but did not provide a blood specimen, they would
have the sample weight value assigned as &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and
Other Related Variables </strong></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020" target="_blank">2017-
March 2020 Demographics File</a> contains demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews
as well as the sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance
estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU,
respectively) in the demographic data file. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm" target="_blank">Fasting Questionnaire
File</a> includes auxiliary information, such as fasting status, the time of
venipuncture, and the conditions precluding venipuncture. </p>
<p>This laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN). </p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits </strong></p>
<p>An exact lower
limit of detection (LLOD) for RBC folate cannot be calculated because the value
is a composite of whole blood folate, serum folate, and hematocrit. Therefore,
there is no LLOD for the calculated value of RBC folate. Furthermore, the LOD
of this method for whole blood folate depends on the dilution factor (i.e., LOD
= 44 nmol/L whole blood if whole blood hemolysate is only diluted 1/40;
assuming a hematocrit of 40%, this would correspond to a RBC folate
concentration of 110 nmol/L RBC). </p></div>
