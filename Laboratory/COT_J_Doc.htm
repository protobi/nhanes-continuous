        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The specific aims
of the component are: 1) to measure the prevalence and extent of tobacco use;
2) to estimate the extent of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), and
determine trends in exposure to ETS; and 3) to describe the relationship
between tobacco use (as well as exposure to ETS) and chronic health conditions,
including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>Cotinine and
trans-3&rsquo;-hydroxycotinine (hydroxycotinine) are the primary metabolites of
nicotine. The concentrations of cotinine and hydroxycotinine in body fluids can
be used as markers for active smoking and as indices for secondhand smoke (SHS)
exposure. Because their concentrations are greater and their elimination
half-lives significantly longer, these metabolites are generally preferred over
nicotine itself as biomarkers. Cotinine, the primary proximal metabolite of
nicotine, is generally regarded as the marker of choice. The estimated
elimination half-life of cotinine is about 15-20 hours; by contrast, the
half-life of nicotine is only 0.5-3 hours. The half-life of hydroxycotinine is
approximately 5-6 hours, but when hydroxycotinine is generated from cotinine,
its elimination half-life becomes similar to that of cotinine. </p>
<p>Cotinine and
hydroxycotinine can be measured in serum, urine, and salivaâ€•the half-life of
cotinine in all three fluids is essentially the same. Cotinine concentrations
tend to be three to eight times higher in urine than in serum; however, plasma
or serum is the fluid of choice for studies requiring a quantitative assessment
of exposure. For that reason, serum was chosen as the matrix for the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cotinine analyses. In serum,
hydroxycotinine concentrations tend to be two to four times lower than cotinine
concentrations.</p>
<p>The tobacco
component for NHANES also included questionnaire items on current and past use
of cigarettes, pipes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco. Questions were asked
regarding exposure to ETS at home, at work, and in utero among children. In addition,
use of nicotine replacement products (e.g., gum and patch) was collected using
questionnaires.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined
participants aged 3 years and older were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>Serum cotinine
and hydroxycotinine are measured by an isotope-dilution high-performance liquid
chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass
spectrometric (ID HPLC-APCI MS/MS) method. Briefly, the serum sample is spiked
with methyl-D3-cotinine and methyl-D3-hydroxycotinine as internal standards.
The sample is basified and then applied to a supported liquid extraction (SLE)
plate. The analytes are extracted with an isopropanol/methylene chloride
mixture, the organic extract is concentrated, and the residue is injected onto
a C18 HPLC column. The eluent from these injections is monitored by APCI-MS/MS.
The m/z 80 product ion from the m/z 177 quasi-molecular ion is measured for
cotinine and the m/z 80 product ion from the m/z 193 quasi-molecular ion is measured
for hydroxycotinine. Additional ions for the internal standards and for
confirmation are also monitored for the respective compounds. Analyte
concentrations are derived from the area ratios of native-to-labeled compounds
in the sample by comparisons to a standard curve.</p>
<p>Refer to the
Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory methods
used. </p>
<p>There were no
changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this component in the
NHANES 2017-2018 cycle.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Serum
specimens&nbsp;are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, and Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis. </p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)</a>. Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;20&deg;C) conditions
until they are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES
quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>.</p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-control
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained. </p>
<p><b>Analytical Laboratories </b></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed
and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each
control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures
recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported results for all assays
meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo; quality control and quality assurance
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al., 2008). </p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018 Laboratory Data Overview</a>
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic
Guidelines</a>&nbsp;and the on-line NHANES&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">Tutorial</a> for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Sample Weights</b></p>
<p>Exam sample
weights should be used for analyses.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2017">NHANES
2017-2018 Demographics File</a> contains demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews
as well as the sample weight variables. The recommended procedure for variance
estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU,
respectively) in the demographic data file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/fastqx_j.htm">Fasting Questionnaire File</a>
includes auxiliary information such as fasting status, the length of fast, and
the time of venipuncture.</p>
<p>The laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p>Starting in the
2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine) will not be
reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled &ldquo;Albumin
&amp; Creatinine &ndash; Urine&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>The detection
limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two variables are
provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex.,
LBDCOTLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection: the
value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo;
indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For analytes with
analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex. LBDCOTLC =1), an
imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the
lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The
other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXCOT) provides the analytic result for the
analyte. </p>

detection (LLOD in ng/mL) for Cotinine and Hydroxycotinine in serum: </p>
