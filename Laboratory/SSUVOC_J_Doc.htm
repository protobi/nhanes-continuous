        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Human exposure to benzene, furfural, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is
associated with numerous health risks, including potential or known
carcinogenicity (benzene [Smith, 2010], 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [Abraham et.
al., 2011]), respiratory toxicity (benzene [Bahadar et. al., 2014], furfural [NIOSH,
2019]), neurotoxicity, and birth defects (benzene [Bahadar et. al., 2014]).
Human exposure may occur via multiple routes from various sources, including
tobacco smoke (Smith, 2010; Talhout et al. 2006), e-cigarette aerosol (Soussy
et. al., 2016; Behar et. al., 2018; Pankow et. al., 2017), automobile exhaust (Smith,
2010), industrial applications (Smith, 2010; Machado et. al., 2016), and food products (Abraham et. al., 2011; Piggott, 2003; Hodge, 1953). Due to the potential adverse health effects of these VOCs and the U.S.
population&rsquo;s exposure to them, improving the exposure assessment of these
compounds in the general US population and/or in specific population groups is
of public health significance.</p>
<p>VOCs can be metabolized prior to urinary excretion, so VOC exposure can
be assessed by measuring their urine metabolites. An analytical method was
developed to measure metabolites of benzene (<i>trans</i>,<i>trans</i>-Muconic
acid [SSMUCA]; N-Acetyl-S-phenyl-L-cysteine [SSPHMA]), furfural (N-2-Furoylglycine
[SSN2FG]), and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid [SSHMFA];
5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furoylglycine [SSHMFG]), which will greatly improve our
understanding of the extent of exposure to these selected VOCs.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third
subsample of examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>This method is a quantitative procedure to measure urinary metabolites
of benzene, furfural, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural using ultra-performance
liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass
spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Sample preparation involves 1:10 dilution of 50
&micro;L urine samples in ammonium formate buffer, pH 2.9. Chromatographic separation
of each prepared urine specimen is achieved by using a Waters Acquity UPLC HSS
fluoro-phenyl (PFP) column using a mobile phase <i>A</i> (0.02% formic acid)
and a mobile phase <i>B</i> (methanol). The eluate from the column is ionized
using electrospray ionization, which is used to generate and transmit ions into
the mass spectrometer. Comparison of relative response factors (ratio of native
analyte to stable isotope-labeled internal standard) with known standard
concentrations yields individual analyte concentrations in each sample
(Bhandari et. al., 2019).&nbsp; </p>
<p>The
VOC Metabolites II dataset was produced by applying
an improved method for measuring N-Acetyl-S-phenyl-L-cysteine (PHMA). NHANES
cycle 2015-2016 and prior measured PHMA (NHANES variable URXPMA, dataset UVOC_I)
in urine samples at neutral pH. Conversely, NHANES cycle 2017-2018 measured PHMA
(NHANES variable SSPHMA) in urine samples prepared at pH 2.9. This acid
treatment converts the PHMA precursor, i.e., pre-PHMA to PHMA; thus the new
method quantifies both free PHMA and PHMA formed from the acid dehydration of
pre-PHMA (Bhandari et. al., 2019). This new PHMA measure more accurately
assesses benzene exposure (Sterz et. al., 2010). The PHMA results reported in NHANES 2017-2018 (SSPHMA) should not be directly compared with PHMA (URXPMA) reported in previous NHANES analyses (Tevis et. al., 2020).</p>
<p>Refer to the
Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory
methods used.</p>
<p>This is a new
component in the 2017-2018 survey cycle.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Urine specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta GA for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are
discussed in the 2017-2018 NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM)</a>. Vials are stored under
appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they are shipped to National Center
for Environmental Health for testing. </p>
<p>The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet
the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>.</p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is
monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a
structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality
of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each laboratory staff member is
observed for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing
procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels
were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the
quality of the analyses performed by the CDC and contract laboratories. In the
MEC, these methods include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry
run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat
testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for
all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules
(Westgard, et al., 1981) when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports
containing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens,
summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures recommended by the
manufacturers were followed. Reported results for all assays meet the Division
of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo; QA/QC performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al., 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data
were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018 Laboratory Data Overview</a>&nbsp;for
general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory
tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided
biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. Additionally,
availability of specimens for surplus projects is lower than for other
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. The specimen availability
can also vary by age or other population characteristics. Analysts should
evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of
interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine
whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a> and the on-line NHANES <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/" target="_blank">Tutorial</a> for details on the use of sample weights and analytic
issues.</p>
<p><b>Subsample Weights</b></p>
<p>The analytes included in this dataset were
measured in all examined participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third
subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special
sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample
weights for this subsample, WTSSAJ2Y, are included in this data file and should
be used when analyzing these data. The sample weights created for this file
used the examination sample weight, i.e., WTMEC2YR, as the base weight. The
base weight was adjusted for additional nonresponse to these lab tests and
re-poststratified to the population total using sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Participants who were part of the eligible population but
who did not provide a urine specimen, or did not have sufficient volume of biospecimens, or who did not give consent for their specimens to be used for
future research are included in the file but they have a sample weight assigned &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and
Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES
laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design and
demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">NHANES
2017-2018 Demographics File</a> contains demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews
as well as the sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance
estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU,
respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>This laboratory data file can
be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey participant
identifier (i.e., SEQN). </p>
<p>Starting in the 2015-2016
NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine) will not be reported in
this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled &ldquo;Albumin &amp;
Creatinine &ndash; Urine&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits </b><br />
<br />
The detection limits were constant for the analytes in
the data set. Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The
variable named ending in &ldquo;L&rdquo; (ex., SSPHMAL) indicates whether the result was
below the limit of detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or
above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result was below the limit
of detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., SSPHMAL=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square
root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., SSPHMA)
provides the analytic result for the analyte. All data are rounded to three
significant figures or three decimal places, whichever is less precise.</p>
<p>The lower limit of detection
(LLOD, in ng/mL) for SSHMFA, SSHMFG, SSMUCA, SSN2FG, and SSPHMA:</p>
