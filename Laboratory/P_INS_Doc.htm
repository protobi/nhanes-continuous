        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program suspended field
operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not
completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore,
data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES
2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March
2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to
the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>Insulin is the
primary hormone responsible for controlling glucose metabolism, and its
secretion is determined by plasma glucose concentration. The insulin molecule
is synthesized in the pancreas as pro-insulin and is later cleaved to form
C-peptide and insulin. The principal function of insulin is to control the
uptake and utilization of glucose in the peripheral tissues. Insulin
concentrations are severely reduced in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
(IDDM) and some other conditions, while insulin concentrations are raised in
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), obesity, and some endocrine
disorders.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined
participants 12 years and older, in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic
sample, were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p><b>Insulin</b><br />
The AIA-PACK IRI is a two-site immunoenzymometric assay, which is performed on a
Tosoh AIA System analyzer. This assay is designed for the quantitative
measurement of Insulin (IRI) in human serum. Insulin present in the test sample
is bound with monoclonal antibody immobilized on a magnetic solid phase and
enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody in the AIA-PACK. The magnetic beads are
washed to remove unbound enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody and are then
incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP).
The amount of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody that binds to the beads is
directly proportional to the insulin concentration in the test sample. A
standard curve is constructed, and unknown sample concentrations are calculated
using this curve.</p>

were processed, stored, and shipped to the University of Missouri-Columbia,
Columbia, MO for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the NHANES<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf" target="_blank"> 2017-2018 </a>and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf" target="_blank">2019-2020 Laboratory Procedures Manuals </a>(LPMs).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they are
shipped to University of Missouri-Columbia for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the NHANES LPMs.</p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs) </b></p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical
Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS
developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract laboratories,
which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981) when testing
NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are
submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in
the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of
concern.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation. <br />
<br />
One variable was created in this data file.&nbsp; The variable LBDINSI was
created using the following formula:</p>
<p><b>LBDINSI: </b>The insulin value in &micro;U/mL (LBXIN) was converted to pmol/L (LBDINSI) by
multiplying by 6.0 (rounded to 2 decimals). </p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19
pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020
after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020
sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because
the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally representative, these
data were combined with data from the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process was applied
to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in
the present file should be used to calculate estimates from the combined cycles.
These sample weights are not appropriate for independent analyses of the
2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative results for either
the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the
NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with
specific weights for that 2-year cycle. </p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017" target="_blank">2017-2018 </a>and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019" target="_blank">2019-2020 Laboratory Data Overview </a>documents for general
information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants.
However, not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all
the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or
other population characteristics. For example, in 2017-March 2020,
approximately 76% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC
provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age
18 and older provided a blood specimen. &nbsp;Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for
item non-response is necessary. </p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic
Guidelines</a> and the on-line <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">NHANES Tutorial </a>for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Subsample Weights <br />
<br />
</b>Insulin was measured in a fasting subsample of
participants 12 years and older. Specific sample weights (WTSAFPRP) for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used when
analyzing these data. Participants included in the fasting subsample but did
not provide a blood specimen (n=346) have an assigned sample weight value of
&ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records. In addition, participants who provided blood specimen but
did not meet the 8 to less than 24 hour fasting criteria (n=268) have the
sample weight value assigned as &ldquo;0&rdquo; (WTSAF2YR =0) as well. Seven out of these 268
participants did not provide enough volume to have their insulin tested.
Insulin measurements for the other 261 participants are included in the
dataset. However, to include these data in the analysis, a reweighting is
required. There are another 112 participants in the fasting subsample that did
not provide enough blood; therefore, they did not have insulin measured.
However, these participants have data in at least one other fasting subsample
tests (e.g., plasma fasting glucose). Therefore, they have a sample weight
larger than &ldquo;0,&rdquo; regardless of missing their insulin test results.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Demographic and Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020" target="_blank">2017-March 2020 Pre-Pandemic Demographics File </a>contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables
(SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>In the 2017-March
pre-pandemic NHANES cycle, the variables PHAFSTHR (total length of &ldquo;food fast&rdquo;,
hours) and PHAFSTMN (Total length of &ldquo;food fast&rdquo;, minutes) will not be reported
in this file. PHAFSTHR and PHAFSTMN can be found in the 2017-March 2020 <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm" target="_blank">Fasting
Questionnaire File (P_FASTQX)</a>. The fasting questionnaire
data file also includes additional auxiliary information such as fasting
status, and the time of venipuncture.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>The detection
limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two variables are
provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex.,
LBDINLC<i>) </i>indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection:
the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo;
indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other variable
prefixed LBX (ex., LBXIN<i>) </i>provides the analytic result for that analyte.
For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
LBDINLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This
value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt[2]). </p>
<p>The lower limit of
detection (LLOD, in uU/mL) for insulin is:</p>
