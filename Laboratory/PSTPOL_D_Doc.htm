        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Organochlorine pesticides are a diverse group of synthetic chemicals that persist in the environment and tend to bio accumulate. Most of these chemicals have been banned from use in the U.S. Assessment of exposure to persistent organochlorine pesticides in a representative sample of the U.S. population is needed to determine current prevalence and level of exposure and the potential for human health effects from exposure to these chemicals.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-third subsample were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>Eight&nbsp;organochlorine pesticides and metabolites were measured in serum through the use of automated liquid/liquid extraction and subsequent sample clean-up. Final determination of target analytes was performed by isotope dilution gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry GC/IDHRMS. The analytical method is described in Jones et al, 2012, which is a modification of the method described by Sjodin et al., 2004 and Barr et al., 2003. </p>
<p>Refer to the Laboratory Methods Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory methods used.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this component in the NHANES 2005-2006 cycle.&nbsp; However, the samples were measured in a pooled fashion for 2005-2006 rather than individual measurements.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Serum samples were processed, stored and shipped to the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2005-2006/manuals/lab.pdf"><span style="color: #003399;">Laboratory Procedure Manual (LPM)</span></a>. Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30<sup><span style="font-size: 10px;">o</span></sup>C) conditions until they were shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2005-2006/manuals/lab.pdf"><span style="color: #003399;">NHANES LPM</span></a>. </p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo; quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al. 2008).<br />

<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a> and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial</a> for details on the use of sample weights and analytic issues.</p>
<p><strong>Subsample Weights</strong></p>
<p>The original pooled-sample weight created for this file released in July 2013 was not correctly stratified to the U.S population total. This new file contains the corrected sample weight (WTSMSMPA). No changes or corrections were made to the lab analyte data in this new release. Any analyses of the data using the old public use data file should be repeated using the corrected sample weight on this file.</p>
<p>PBDEs and PBB-153 were measured in a one third subsample of persons 12 years and over, and samples were pooled in groups of 8 samples per pool within 32 demographic groups. The analysis of NHANES 2005-2006 pooled-sample data must be conducted with the basic demographic variables provided in this data file. This pooled-sample data file cannot be linked to other NHANES 2005-2006 data. &nbsp;Because each sample person does not have an equal probability of selection, sample weighting is needed to produce correct population estimates of means, percentiles, and other descriptive statistics. </p>
<p>The pooled-sample weights required to produce estimates from these data are included in this data file.&nbsp;The analysis of pooled-samples from survey data is a relatively new field of study, and there is currently no established method to produce variance estimates for these pooled results.&nbsp;These data cannot be analyzed using software designed for complex surveys because design features are not available.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Rationale and Methods Used to Create Pooled Results</strong></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provide an ongoing assessment of the US population's exposure to environmental chemicals by using biomonitoring in conjunction with CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Characterizing the distributions of concentrations of environmental compounds or their metabolites in the US population is a primary objective of CDC's biomonitoring program. Historically, this characterization has been based on individual measurements of these compounds in body fluid or tissue from representative samples of the population. Pooling samples allows for larger sample volumes, which can result in lower limits of detection and reduces the number of measurements and costs. For the first time in NHANES 2005-2006, a weighted pooled-sample design was implemented to facilitate pooling samples before making analytical measurements (pooled results were not weighted in NHANES 2001-2002). Table 1 lists the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) names, common abbreviation, and NHANES variable name for the analytes included in this data file.</p>
<p>Pools were prepared from serum collected from a random one-third subset of the NHANES 2005&ndash;2006 participants aged 12 years and older. Samples were pooled based on gender, race and Hispanic origin, and age. To implement the pooled-sample design, each participant sample was identified as belonging to one of 32 demographic groups based on race and Hispanic origin (non-Hispanic white: NHW, non-Hispanic black: NHB, Mexican American: MA,:&nbsp;not non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white or Mexican-American: OTHER), gender (Male, Female), and age group (12-19, 20-39, 40-59, and 60+ years of age and older). Eight (8) samples were included in each pool. The number of pools created for each of the 32 demographic groups varied depending on the total number of individual samples available in a demographic group. The one-third subset of NHANES 2005-2006 represents 2345 individual samples, but because the pooled-sample design requires that all samples be of sufficient volume and that there be the same number of samples in each pool, only 1973 samples were available to create 247 pools with 8 samples per pool. &nbsp;See more details on pool sample formation and exceptions in Table 2. The variable SAMPLEID denotes the identification number for each pool and ranges from 1 through 247. Please refer to the Pooled-Sample Technical Support file (POOLTF_D) for detailed information on individual participants included in each pool.</p>
<p>In order to incorporate sample weighting into the pooled-sample design it was necessary to use a different volume of material from each sample contributing to a pool. The volume chosen for each sample in a pool was based on the ratio of its sampling weight to the sum of the sampling weights of all samples in the pool. To physically accomplish the pooling in the laboratory required that the ratio of the largest to the smallest sampling weight of samples in the same pool be no larger than about 4 or 5. The individual samples were sorted/stratified by sampling weight within each of the 32 demographic groups and pools were formed using samples with sampling weights adjacent to one another in the sorted list. The number of samples in the one-third subset, the number of samples available, the number of these samples that were usable, and the number of pools formed in each demographic group are presented in Table 2. Once the pools were created, summed sampling weights were further adjusted to account for the unused samples. These adjusted summed sampling weights are represented by the variable named WTSMSMPA.</p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong></p>
<p>In the dataset, the whole weight detection limit (ng/g serum) is a variable and dependent on the available sample size, however, the variation in sample size was low. Lipid adjusted detection limits are variable (ng/g lipid) due to differences of the lipid levels measured in individual pools/specimens. In cases where the result was below the limit of detection, the value for that variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of 2. </p>
