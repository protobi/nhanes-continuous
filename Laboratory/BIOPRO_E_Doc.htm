      <div id="Sections">
        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>This battery of measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of certain liver, heart, and kidney diseases, acid-base imbalance in the respiratory and metabolic systems, other diseases involving lipid metabolism and various endocrine disorders as well as other metabolic or nutritional disorders. </p>
<p><strong>1. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)</strong> <br />
Alanine aminotransferase measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of certain liver diseases (e.g., viral hepatitis and cirrhosis) and heart diseases. Elevated levels of the transaminases can indicate myocardial infarction, hepatic disease, muscular dystrophy, or organ damage. Serum elevations of ALT activity are rarely observed except in parenchymal liver disease, since ALT is a more liver-specific enzyme than aspartate aminotransferase (AST).</p>
<p><strong>2. Albumin <br />
</strong>Albumin measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous diseases primarily involving the liver or kidneys</p>
<p><strong>3. Alkaline phosphatase <br />
</strong>Alkaline phosphatase measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of liver, bone, and parathyroid disease.</p>
<p><strong>4. Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)</strong> <br />
AST measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of certain types of liver and heart disease. Elevated levels of the transaminases can signal myocardial infarction, hepatic disease, muscular dystrophy, or organ damage. </p>
<p><strong>5. Bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub>)</strong> <br />
Together with pH determination, bicarbonate measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous potentially serious disorders associated with acid-base imbalance in the respiratory and metabolic systems.</p>
<p><strong>6. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)</strong> <br />
BUN measurements are used in the diagnosis of certain renal and metabolic diseases. The determination of serum urea nitrogen is the most widely used test for the evaluation of kidney function. The test is frequently requested in conjunction with the serum creatinine test for the differential diagnosis of prerenal, renal, and postrenal uremia. High BUN levels are associated with impaired renal function, increased protein catabolism, nephritis, intestinal obstruction, urinary obstruction, metallic poisoning, cardiac failure, peritonitis, dehydration, malignancy, pneumonia, surgical shock, Addison's disease, and uremia. Low BUN levels are associated with amyloidosis, acute liver disease, pregnancy, and nephrosis. Normal variations are observed according to a person's age and sex, the time of day, and diet, particularly protein intake. </p>
<p><strong>7. Calcium</strong> <br />
Calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid disease, bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany. Urinary calcium measurement is used in the differential diagnosis of hypercaluria.</p>
<p><strong>8. Cholesterol <br />
</strong>An elevated cholesterol level is associated with diabetes, nephrosis, hypothyroidism, biliary obstruction, and those rare cases of idiopathic hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia; low levels are associated with hyperthyroidism, hepatitis, and sometimes severe anemia or infection. </p>
<p><strong>9. Creatinine</strong> <br />
Creatinine measurements are useful in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases. </p>
<p><strong>10. Gammaglutamyl Transaminase (GGT) <br />
</strong>GT measurement is principally used to diagnose and monitor hepatobiliary disease. It is currently the most sensitive enzymatic indicator of liver disease, with normal values rarely found in the presence of hepatic disease. It is also used as a sensitive screening test for occult alcoholism. Elevated levels are found in patients who chronically take drugs such as phenobarbital and phenytoin. </p>
<p><strong>11. Glucose</strong> <br />
Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma and of carbohydrate metabolism disorders, including diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, and idiopathic hypoglycemia.<br />
<br />
<strong>12. Iron <br />
</strong>Iron (non-heme) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as iron deficiency anemia, chronic renal disease, and hemochromatosis (a disease associated with widespread deposit in the tissues of two iron-containing pigments, hemosiderin and hemofuscin, and characterized by pigmentation of the skin).</p>
<p><strong>13. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)</strong> <br />
LDH measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases such as acute viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and metastatic carcinoma of the liver; cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction; and tumors of the lungs or kidneys.</p>
<p><strong>14. Phosphorus <br />
</strong>There is a reciprocal relationship between serum calcium and inorganic phosphorus. Any increase in the level of inorganic phosphorus causes a decrease in the calcium level by a mechanism not clearly understood. Hyperphosphatemia is associated with vitamin D hypervitaminosis, hypoparathyroidism, and renal failure. Hypophosphatemia is associated with rickets, hyperparathyroidism, and Fanconi syndrome.</p>
<p>Measurements of inorganic phosphorus are used in the diagnosis and treatment of various disorders, including parathyroid gland, kidney diseases, and vitamin D imbalance. </p>
<p><strong>15-17. Potassium, Chloride, and Sodium <br />
</strong>Hypokalemia (low serum potassium level) is associated with body potassium deficiency, excessive potassium loss caused by prolonged diarrhea or prolonged periods of vomiting and increased secretion of mineralocorticosteroids. Hyperkalemia (increased serum potassium level) is associated with oliguria, anuria, and urinary obstruction. <br />
<br />
Low serum chloride values are associated with salt-losing nephritis; Addisonian crisis, prolonged vomiting, and metabolic acidosis caused by excessive production or diminished excretion of acids. High serum chloride values are associated with dehydration and conditions causing decreased renal blood flow, such as congestive heart failure. <br />
<br />
Sodium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving electrolyte imbalance. </p>
<p><strong>18. Total Bilirubin <br />
</strong>Elevated levels are associated with hemolytic jaundice, paroxysmal hemoglobinuria, pernicious anemia, polycythemia, icterus neonatorum, internal hemorrhage, acute hemolytic anemia, malaria, and septicemia. <br />
<br />
Low bilirubin levels are associated with aplastic anemia, and certain types of secondary anemia resulting from toxic therapy for carcinoma and chronic nephritis.</p>
<p><strong>19. Total Protein</strong> <br />
Total protein measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of diseases involving the liver, kidney, or bone marrow, as well as other metabolic or nutritional disorders. <br />
<br />
<strong>20. Triglycerides</strong> <br />
Triglyceride measurements are used in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, liver obstruction, and other diseases involving lipid metabolism and various endocrine disorders and in the treatment of patients with these diseases. </p>
<p><strong>21. Uric Acid <br />
</strong>Uric acid measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous renal and metabolic disorders, including renal failure, gout, leukemia, psoriasis, starvation, or other wasting conditions and in the treatment of patients receiving cytotoxic drugs.</p>

<p>The 21 analytes described in these methods constitute the routine biochemistry profile. <strong>The analyses were performed using a Beckman Synchron LX20 and Beckman UniCel® DxC800 Synchron.</strong> Each analyte is described separately within each pertinent section of this document. NOTE: Glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides were analyzed as part of this profile, but the results do not replace the formalized reference methods data from NHANES 2005-2006 samples analyzed at other institutions. </p>
<p><strong>1. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) <br />
</strong>The LX20 uses an enzymatic rate method to measure ALT activity in serum or plasma. In the reaction, ALT catalyzes the reversible transamination of L-alanine and a-ketoglutarate to pyruvate and L-glutamate. The pyruvate is then reduced to lactate in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with the concurrent oxidation of NADH to NAD. The system monitors the rate of change in absorbance at 340 nm over a fixed-time interval. The rate of change in absorbance is directly proportional to the ALT activity in the sample. <br />

<p>ALT measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of liver and heart disease.</p>
<p><strong>2. Albumin <br />
</strong>The LX20 method used to measure the albumin concentration on the LX20 is a bichromatic digital endpoint method. In the reaction, the albumin combines with Bromcresol Purple (BCP) reagent to form a complex. The system monitors the change in absorbance at 600 nm. The change in absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration of albumin in the sample. </p>

<p>Albumin measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving the liver and/or kidneys and are frequently used to assess nutritional status because plasma levels of albumin are dependent on protein intake. </p>
<p><strong>3. Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)</strong> <br />
The LX20 uses an enzymatic rate method to measure the AST activity in serum or plasma. In the reaction, the AST catalyzes the reversible transamination of L-aspartate and a-ketoglutarate to oxaloacetate and L-glutamate. The oxaloacetate is then reduced to malate in the presence of malate dehydrogenase with the concurrent oxidation of NADH to NAD. The system monitors the rate of change in absorbance at 340 nm over a fixed-time interval. The rate of change in absorbance is directly proportional to the AST activity in the sample. </p>

<p>AST measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of certain types of liver and heart diseases.</p>
<p><strong>4. Alkaline phosphatase <br />
</strong>The LX system uses an enzymatic rate using a 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) buffer to measure ALP activity in serum or plasma. In the reaction, the ALP catalyzes the hydrolysis of the colorless organic phosphate ester substrate, p-Nitrophenylphosphate, to the yellow colored product p-Nitrophenol and phosphate. This reaction occurs at an alkaline pH of 10.3. The system monitors the rate of change in absorbance at 410 nm over a fixed-time interval. This rate of change in absorbance is directly proportional to the ALP activity in the serum. <br />

This rate of change in absorbance is directly proportional to the ALP activity in the serum. </p>
<p><strong>5. Bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub>) <br />
</strong>The LX20 system uses indirect (or diluted) ISE methodology to measure the total CO<sub>2</sub> level in serum, plasma or urine. The system measures the rate of pH change as CO<sub>2</sub> ions diffuse across a membrane. The electrode used for CO<sub>2</sub> determination is actually a pH electrode with the tip covered by a silicone rubber membrane and lowers the pH of a bicarbonate solution between the tip of the membrane and the tip of the pH electrode. The rate of pH change is directly proportional to the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the sample. </p>

<p>Carbon dioxide measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders associated with changes in acid-base balance.</p>
<p><strong>6. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) <br />
</strong>The LX20 modular chemistry (BUNm) is used to quantitatively determine the concentration of blood urea nitrogen in serum or plasma by means of the enzymatic conductivity rate method.  A precise volume of sample is injected into the urease reagent in a reaction cup containing an electrode that responds to changes in solution conductivity.  Electronic circuits determine the rate of increase in conductivity, which is directly proportional to the concentration of urea in the sample. </p>

<p>Urea nitrogen measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of certain renal and metabolic diseases in conjunction with creatinine measurements.</p>
<p><strong>7. Calcium</strong> <br />
The LX20 system uses indirect (or diluted) ISE methodology to measure calcium concentration in serum, plasma, or urine. The system determines calcium concentration by measuring calcium ion activity in solution. When the sample buffer mixture contacts the electrode, calcium ions complex with the ionophore at the electrode surface. Changes in potential develop at the electrode surface as the reaction occurs. These changes in potential are referenced to a sodium reference electrode. The reference signal is used in calculating the analyte concentrations based on the Nernst equation. <br />

These changes in potential are referenced to a sodium reference electrode. The reference signal is used in calculating the analyte concentrations based on the Nernst equation.</p>
<p><strong>8. Cholesterol <br />
</strong>The LX20 uses the timed-endpoint method to measure the cholesterol concentration in serum or plasma. In the reaction, the cholesterol esterase hydrolyzes cholesterol esters to free cholesterol and fatty acids. The free cholesterol is oxidized to cholesten-3-one and hydrogen peroxide by cholesterol oxidase. Peroxidase catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with 4-aminoantipyrine and phenol to produce a colored quinoneimine product. The system monitors the change in absorbance at 520 nm at a fixed-time interval. The change in absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration of cholesterol in the sample.</p>

<p>Cholesterol measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and in the diagnosis of metabolic disorders involving lipids and lipoproteins.</p>
<p><strong>9. Creatinine <br />
</strong>The LX20 modular chemistry side uses the Jaffe rate method (kinetic alkaline picrate) to determine the concentration of creatinine in serum, plasma, or urine. A precise volume of sample is introduced into a reaction cup containing an alkaline picrate solution. Absorbance readings are taken at both 520 nm and 560 nm. Creatinine from the sample combines with the reagent to produce a red color complex.

The DxC800 modular chemistry side uses the Jaffe rate method (kinetic alkaline picrate) to determine the concentration of creatinine in serum, plasma, or urine. The creatinine calibration is traceable to an isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) reference method. The method on the DxC800 is IDMS Standardized. A precise volume of sample is introduced into a reaction cup containing an alkaline picrate solution. Absorbance readings are taken at 520 nm between 19 and 25 seconds after sample injection. Creatinine from the sample combines with the reagent to produce a red color complex.

<p><strong>15-17 Potassium, Chloride, Sodium <br />
</strong>The LX20 system uses indirect (or diluted) I.S.E. methodology to measure potassium in biological fluids.

<br />
The LX20 system uses indirect (or diluted) I.S.E. methodology to determine chloride concentration in biological fluids. Chloride is measured using an Ag/AgCl electrode. At the face of the electrode, solid AgCl dissolves to the extent as to saturate the solution around the tip with silver (Ag<sup>+</sup>) and Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) ions until equilibrium is established. The product of the ion concentrations in solution, at equilibrium, with an excess of the slightly soluble AgCl is defined as the solubility product constant (Ksp). When chloride sample is added, the Ksp of the solution at the tip is disrupted as AgCl precipitates out of solution. To reestablish the equilibrium, Ag+ ions are generated from the tip causing a change in the potential. According to the Nernst equation, this change is proportional to the concentration of chloride in the sample. <br />

<p><strong>The Serum creatinine values in NHANES 2007-2008:</strong> <br />
<br />
Serum creatinine was performed on two instruments using the same method for NHANES 2007-2008. In 2007, the Beckman LX-20 was used to analyze serum creatinine. The 2007 serum creatinine method was not standardized as recommended by the National Kidney Disease Educational Program (NKDEP) (Myers, GL et al. 2006). In 2008, the serum creatinine was performed on the Beckman DXC800 analyzer and was standardized according to NKDEP guidelines. A crossover study on 537 participants was performed during the instrumentation change from the LX-20 to the DXC800 and a Deming regression was generated. The non-standardized participant serum creatinine values from 2007 were adjusted to standardized values using the Deming regression. The average NHANES participant values in 2007 were approximately 0.08 mg/dL higher than 2008 participant values. After the Deming regression was applied to 2007 participants, the participant values from 2007 had approximately the same serum creatinine distribution as participants in 2008. To trend serum creatinine from NHANES 1999-2008 and NHANES III (1988-1994), the analyst should adjust serum creatinine for survey periods (Selvin E, et al. 2007).</p>
