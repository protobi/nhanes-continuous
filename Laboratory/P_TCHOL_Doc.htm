        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program
suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020
cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from
2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to
form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic
data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic
Notes section for more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>Heart disease is
the leading cause of death in the United States (Murphy, et. al., 2018). Blood
lipid levels are fundamental measures included in NHANES that can be used for
cardiovascular risk assessment. The goals the NHANES blood lipid measurements include:
1) monitoring the prevalence and trends in major cardiovascular conditions and
overall risk factors in the U.S.; 2) evaluating prevention and treatment
programs targeting cardiovascular disease in the U.S.; and 3) monitoring the
status of hyperlipidemia. </p>
<p>In 2018, new Blood
Cholesterol Guidelines were released, by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Task Force on
Clinical Practice Guidelines, which aim to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease through cholesterol management (Grundy, et. al., 2018).
The blood lipids measurements in NHANES include
total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoproteins
cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides. The present file provides data on total
cholesterol. Data on LDL-C and triglycerides are provided in the Cholesterol &ndash; Low
&ndash; Density Lipoprotein and Triglycerides (P_TRIGLY)
files, and HDL-C data are provided in Cholesterol - High - Density Lipoprotein
(P_HDL). </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All
examined participants 6 years and older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic sample were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p><b>Total Cholesterol</b></p>
<p>The laboratory
method used to measure total cholesterol is an enzymatic assay. In this
enzymatic assay, esterified cholesterol is converted to cholesterol by
cholesterol esterase. The resulting cholesterol is then acted upon by
cholesterol oxidase to produce cholest-4-en-3-one and hydrogen peroxide. The
hydrogen peroxide then reacts with 4-aminophenazone in the presence of
peroxidase to produce a colored product that is measured at 505 nm (secondary
wavelength = 700 nm). The final step is known as the Trinder reaction. This
method is a single reagent, endpoint reaction that is specific for cholesterol.
</p>
<p>Cholesterol, a
steroid molecule with a hydroxyl group in the C3 position, is synthesized in
many types of tissue, but mainly in the liver and intestinal wall. About 75
percent of cholesterol is newly synthesized, with the remainder originating
from dietary intake. Cholesterol measurement is performed to screen for
atherosclerotic risk and in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving
elevated cholesterol as well as lipid and lipoprotein metabolic disorders. </p>
<p>Refer to the
Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory
methods used.</p>
<p>Serum total cholesterol
levels were directly measured. Please see below the Data Processing and Editing section for more details.
For laboratory methods used for low-density lipoproteins
cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides, and HDL-C, please refer to the accompanying documentation:&nbsp; <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2020/p_trigly.htm" target="_blank">P_TRIGLY </a>and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2020/p_hdl.htm" target="_blank">P_HDL</a>.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Serum specimens
were processed, stored, and shipped to the University of Minnesota,
Minneapolis, MN for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf" target="_blank">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf" target="_blank">2019-2020 </a>Laboratory
Procedures Manuals (LPM). Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C)
conditions until they are shipped to University of Minnesota for testing. </p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the NHANES LPM.</p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs)</b> </p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical
Laboratories</b> </p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
specimens collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens. </p>
<p>NCHS developed and
distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined
the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981) when testing NHANES
specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping
or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data.
The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern. </p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation. </p>
<p>One derived
variable was created in this data file. The variable was created using the
following formula:</p>
<p><b>LBDTCSI</b></p>
<p>The total
cholesterol in mg/dL (LBXTC) was converted to mmol/L (LBDTCSI) by multiplying
by 0.02586. </p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field
operations in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey
locations in the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the
remaining 12 locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not
nationally representative, these data were combined with data from the previous
cycle (2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the demographic data file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not
appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield
nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the
2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional
information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the
previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year
cycle. </p>

Overview documents for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over
800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. For example, in 2017-March 2020, approximately 76% of children aged
1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through
phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older provided a blood
specimen.&nbsp; Analysts should evaluate the
extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as
well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether
additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary. </p>

</p>
<p><strong>Total Cholesterol Values from the NHANES 2017&ndash;March 2020 Pre-Pandemic Sample
</strong></p>
<p>The laboratory that performed total cholesterol assays for NHANES samples from 2017 to March 2020 participated in the CDC Lipid Standardization Program (LSP) that monitors the quality of laboratory results over time. The LSP requires comparing assay results to a CDC control pool to assess lab result quality. Acceptable performance for total cholesterol values is defined as meeting criteria for maximum allowable bias (within 3% of the CDC reference value) and maximum allowable standard deviation (within 4.0 mg/dL for values 100-149.9 mg/dL and 3% of the CDC reference value for values above 150 mg/dL). In 2019, the mean bias reported by the laboratory exceeded the criterion of 3% mean allowable bias (the maximum quarterly bias was   -4.7%). The underlying cause of the downward drift in assay performance most likely resulted from reagent and calibration variation.  NHANES evaluated whether this amount of drift could result in a downward shift in the population distribution for 2017-March 2020 estimates of high total cholesterol. The results indicated that there were minimal differences between prevalence estimates of high total cholesterol based on the original total cholesterol values and those based on values adjusted to compensate for the downward bias. For example, the crude prevalence of high total cholesterol among adults 20 years and older was 10.05% using original lab values versus 10.09% using adjusted values. For subgroups for sex and age, the crude prevalence estimates did not differ by more than 0.1 percentage points. Therefore, unadjusted laboratory values for total cholesterol for 2017-March 2020 were released in the dataset. </p>
<p><b>Demographic and
Other Related Variables </b></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020" target="_blank">NHANES 2017-March 2020 Pre-Pandemic
Demographics File</a> contains demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews
as well as the sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance
estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU,
respectively) in the demographic data file. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm" target="_blank">Fasting Questionnaire File </a>includes auxiliary information, such as fasting
status, length of fast, and the time of venipuncture. </p>
<p>The laboratory
data file can be linked to other NHANES data file using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN). </p>
