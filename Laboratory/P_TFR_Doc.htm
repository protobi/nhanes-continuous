        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program suspended field operations in March
2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data
collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected
data are not nationally
representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were
combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>Soluble
transferrin receptor (sTfR) is a measure of iron deficiency and is particularly
useful in people with inflammation, infection, or chronic disease, where
ferritin levels do not correlate with true iron levels. Low storage of
iron can lead to iron deficiency anemia. High levels of iron storage, also
called iron overload, occurs when excess iron is accumulated in the body,
primarily the liver.</p>
<p>The objectives of
this component are: 1) to provide data for monitoring secular trends in
measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 2) to evaluate the
effects of people's habits and behaviors, such as physical activity and the use
of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on nutritional status; and 3) to
evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and public health policies,
including welfare reform legislation, food fortification policy, and child
nutrition programs on the nutritional status of the U.S. population. </p>
<p>These data will be
used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific nutrients in the
population and subgroups, to provide population reference data, and to estimate
the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors to serum levels of
nutrients. Data will be used for research to further define nutrient
requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and health
promotion. </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined
participants aged 1 to 5 years and female participants aged 12 to 49 years, in the NHANES
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample, were
eligible. </p>
<p>Transferrin receptor was measured among examined
participants aged 1 to 5 years and 12 years and older in NHANES 2017-2018. In
the NHANES 2019-2020 data collection cycle, the target group for serum transferrin
receptor test was changed to only include examined participants aged 1 to 5
years and female participants aged 12 to 49 years. Therefore, only data from
child participants aged 1 to 5 years and female participants aged 12 to 49
years are available for both data collection cycles and included in the present
dataset. </p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>The method
principle for measurement of sTfR is a particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay that uses Roche kits on
the Cobas&reg; c501 clinical analyzer. Latex particles coated with anti-sTfR
antibodies react with the antigen in the sample to form an antigen/antibody
complex. Following agglutination, the precipitate is determined photometrically.

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Serum samples were
processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National
Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, GA for analysis. </p>
<p>Detailed instructions
on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/manuals.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/manuals.aspx?BeginYear=2019">2019-2020
NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manuals (LPM)</a>. Vials are stored
under appropriate frozen (-30&deg;C) conditions until they are shipped to National
Center for Environmental Health for testing. </p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the NHANES LPMs. </p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</strong></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed
for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing
procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical Laboratories</strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include
performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.
1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were
followed. Reported results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory
Sciences&rsquo; QA and QC performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to
the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al. 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or
improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation.</p>
<p>One variable was
created in this data file. The variable LBDTFRSI was created using the following:
</p>
<p><strong>LBDTFRSI</strong>: The transferrin receptor value
in mg/L (LBXTFR) was converted to nmol/L (LBDTFRSI) by multiplying LBXTFR by
11.8. </p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19
pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020
after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020
sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because
the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally representative, these
data were combined with data from the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process was applied
to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in
the present file should be used to calculate estimates from the combined
cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate for independent analyses of
the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative results for
either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer
to the NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with
specific weights for that 2-year cycle. </p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019">2019-2020 Laboratory Data Overview</a> for general information on NHANES
laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory tests performed
on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided biospecimens or
enough volume for all the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can
also vary by age or other population characteristics. For example, in 2017-March
2020, approximately 76%
of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether the data are useable
without additional re-weighting for item non-response. </p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic
Guidelines</a> and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial</a> for details on the use of sample
weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and Other Related Variables</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020">NHANES 2017-March 2020 Pre-Pandemic
Demographics File</a> contains demographic data, health indicators, and
other related information collected during household interviews as well as the
sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation
requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively)
in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm">Fasting
Questionnaire File</a> includes auxiliary information, such as fasting
status, length of fast, and the time of venipuncture. </p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES
data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong></p>
<p>The
detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in
&ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex., LBDTFRLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result was below the limit of detection.&nbsp; For analytes with analytic
results below the lower limit of detection (ex., LBDTFRLC =1),
an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is
the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The
other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXTFR<em>,
</em>provides the analytic result for that analyte.</p>
<p>The lower limit of detection (LLOD in mg/L)&nbsp;for LBXTFR:&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>
