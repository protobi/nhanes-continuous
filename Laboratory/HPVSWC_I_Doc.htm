        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the most
common sexually transmitted infections in the United States. Cervical infection
with certain types of HPV is a major risk factor for cervical cancer in women.
The &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; types of HPV (e.g., HPV 16, 18) are associated with cervical
cancer as well as other anogenital cancers, and the &ldquo;low-risk&rdquo; types of HPV (e.g.,
HPV 6, 11) with genital warts. No national surveillance system exists to
measure the full burden of HPV infection, and no reliable national population
estimate of HPV exists. NHANES offers a unique opportunity to assess the
prevalence of HPV infection in the general population.</p>
<p>Reducing the prevalence of HPV infection is a
Developmental Healthy People 2010 objective: &ldquo;Reducing the number of new HPV
cases can help minimize the overall number of cases of high risk subtypes
associated with cervical cancer in females...&rdquo; Detection and typing of HPV DNA
in vaginal swabs will allow evaluation of trends in prevalence of type-specific
HPV infection by age, sexual behavior, and race/ethnicity. Three HPV vaccines
(Gardasil, Gardasil 9, and Cervarix) are licensed and recommended for use in females.
Two vaccines are licensed and recommended for use in males (Gardasil and
Gardasil 9). In mid-2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunizations (ACIP)
recommended routine vaccination of females aged 11 or 12 years and for those
13-26 years not previously vaccinated. In December 2011, ACIP recommended
routine vaccination of males aged 11 or 12 years and for those aged 13 through
21 years not previously vaccinated. As a vaccine becomes more widely used, the
national prevalence of HPV infection will be critical for evaluating
vaccination strategies in the United States.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined female participants aged 14-59 years were
eligible. This public data file includes data for examined participants aged 18
to 59 years. Please see <i>Analytic Notes</i>
about the release of data for adolescents aged 14-17 years.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>DNA extraction was performed with a modified protocol and
the commercial QIAamp kit (Qiagen, 2003). Presence of high-risk HPV in the
extracted participant DNA is determined with the Cobas Human Papillomavirus
(HPV) test. This qualitative in-vitro diagnostics test uses oligonucleotide
probes labeled with four different fluorescent dyes. The primers target a DNA
region of approximately 200 nucleotides within the polymorphic L1 region of the
HPV genome to detect 14 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51,
52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68) in a single analysis. The test reported concurrently
the presence of one or more of these types at clinically relevant infection
levels, however the test was modified from the FDA approved format (sample type
and extraction) and results cannot be used clinically. Refer to the Laboratory
Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory methods used.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Vaginal swab samples were processed, stored, and shipped
to the Chronic Viral Diseases Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens
and Pathology, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed instructions on specimen collection and
processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES
Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM)</a>. Swabs were stored at room
temperature until they were shipped to the National Center for Emerging and
Zoonotic Infectious Diseases for testing.</p>
<p>Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">LPM</a>.</p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff
member is observed for equipment operation, specimen collection and
preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are given to each
staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that
required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods
include performing blind split samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition,
contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>Progress reports containing any problems encountered
during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control
pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable
values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation.<br />
</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015">2015-2016
Laboratory Data Overview</a>&nbsp;for general information on NHANES
laboratory data.</p>
<p><b>Sample Weights</b></p>
<p>MEC exam sample weights should be used for analyses.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2015">2015-2016
Demographics File</a> contains demographic data, health indicators, and
other related information collected during household interviews as well as the
sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation
requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively)
in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other
NHANES data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p>The Questionnaire data files contain socio-economic data,
health indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. Certain sensitive data on participants under 18 years of age (e.g.,
HPV typing results, sexual behavior variables) are not included in the public
use files. These data may be requested as described in the NHANES guidelines.</p>
<p>The public release data file includes HPV vaginal swab
data for participants aged 18-59. HPV vaginal swab data for youth aged 14-17
years are available through the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/">NCHS Research Data Center (RDC)</a>.</p>
<p><b>Roche Cobas HPV DNA Test</b></p>
<p>The Roche Cobas HPV test is qualitative and only
determines the presence or absence of high-risk HPV. If any analyte (HPV 16,
HPV 18, or Other High-risk HPV) is indicated as positive (POS) in the Cobas
result file, the result for the sample ID will be recorded as positive. If all
of the HPV analytes are negative (NEG) in the Cobas result file the result for
the sample ID will be recorded as negative. If any of the analytes are
indicated as invalid in the Cobas result file, the DNA from that sample will be
re-tested one time to obtain valid results. If the repeated result is still invalid,
the final result will be recorded as inadequate (Cobas
Operator&rsquo;s Manual, 2009).</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>If data is
qualitative, the use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not applicable. </p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">NHANES Analytic
Guidelines</a> and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/">Tutorial</a> for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p></div>
