        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Ferritin is a protein that contains iron
and is found in red blood cells. Ferritin levels are used primarily in
evaluating the body&rsquo;s iron metabolism and levels of iron storage or reserves,
which can be too low or too high. Low storage of iron can lead to iron
deficiency anemia. High levels of iron storage, also called iron overload,
occurs when excess iron is accumulated in the body, primarily the liver. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objectives of
this component are: 1) to provide data for monitoring secular trends in
measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 2) to evaluate the
effects of people's habits and behaviors, such as physical activity and the use
of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on nutritional status; and 3) to
evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and public health policies,
including welfare reform legislation, food fortification policy, and child
nutrition programs, on the nutritional status of the U.S. population. </p>
<p>These data will be
used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific nutrients in the population
and subgroups, to provide population reference data, and to estimate the
contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors to serum levels of
nutrients. Data will be used for research to further define nutrient
requirements, as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and health
promotion. </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined
participants 1-5 years old and 12 years and older were eligible. </p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>The method for
measurement of Ferritin on the Roche Cobas&reg; e601 is a sandwich principle with a
total duration time of 18 minutes. The 1<sup>st </sup>incubation uses 10 &mu;L of
sample, a ferritin-specific antibody and a labeled ferritin-specific antibody
to form a sandwich complex. The 2<sup>nd</sup> <sup></sup>incubation occurs after the
addition of microparticles that cause the complex to bind to the solid phase.
The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the
microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode.
Unbound substances are then removed. Application of a voltage to the electrode
then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
Results are determined via a calibration curve.</p>
<p>Refer to the
Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory
methods used.<br />

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Serum specimens
were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory Sciences,
National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed instructions
on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM). </a>Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions
until they are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">LPM</a>. </p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed
for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing
procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels
were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods
include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.
1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were
followed. Reported results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo;
QA/QC performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al. 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to
the performing laboratory for confirmation.<br />
<br />
One variable was created in this data file. The variable LBDFERSI was created using
the formula: </p>
<p>
<b>LBDFERSI</b>: The ferritin value in
ng/mL (LBXFER) was converted to &micro;g/L (LBDFERSI) by multiplying LBXFER by 1.00 (rounded
to 3 significant figures). </p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href=" https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018 Laboratory Data Overview</a>
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume&nbsp;for all the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80%  of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">NHANES Analytic Guidelines </a>and the on-line <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">NHANES Tutorial </a>for details
on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2017">NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics </a>File
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/fastqx_j.htm">Fasting
Questionnaire File </a>includes auxiliary information, such as fasting
status, length of fast, and the time of venipuncture. </p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES
data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>The
detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending &ldquo;LC&rdquo;
(ex., LBDFERLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection:
the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo;
indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed
LBX (ex., LBXFER) provides the analytic result for that analyte.&nbsp; For analytes with analytic
results below the lower limit of detection (ex., LBDFERLC=1),
an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the
lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). </p>
<p>The lower limit of detection (LLOD in ng/mL)&nbsp;for LBXFER:&nbsp;<i> </i></p>
