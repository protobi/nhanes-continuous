        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program suspended field
operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not
completed and the collected data are not nationally representative.
Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from
the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please
refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>C-reactive protein
(CRP) is an acute phase protein synthesized in the liver. It is involved in the
activation of complement, enhancement of phagocytosis, and detoxification of
substances released from damaged tissue. It is one of the most sensitive,
though nonspecific, indicators of inflammation. CRP levels may rise within six
hours of an inflammatory stimulus. Measurement of CRP concentrations by this
highly sensitive method is performed primarily to ascertain the level of
cardiovascular disease risk in individuals who have no existing inflammatory
conditions. Increases in CRP concentration are non-specific and should be used
in conjunction with traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute
coronary syndromes.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined
participants aged 1 year and older, in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic
sample, were eligible. </p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>This is a
two-reagent, immunoturbidimetric system. The specimen is first combined with a
Tris buffer, then incubated. The second reagent (latex particles coated with
mouse anti-human CRP antibodies) is then added. In the presence of circulating
CRP the latex particles aggregate, forming immune complexes. These complexes
cause an increase in light scattering that is proportional to the CRP
concentration. The light absorbance resulting from this light scatter is read
against a stored CRP standard curve. The concentration of CRP is determined
from this line. Turbidity is measured at a primary wavelength of 546 nm
(secondary wavelength 800 nm).</p>

Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory
methods used.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

are processed, stored, and shipped to the University of Minnesota &ndash; Advanced
Research Diagnostics Laboratory (ARDL), Minneapolis, MN for analysis. </p>
<p>Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed
in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf" target="_blank">2017-2018</a>

Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they were
shipped to the University of Minnesota for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES
LPMs.</p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed
for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing
procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels
were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods
include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for
all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.,
1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern. </p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19
pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020
after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020
sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because
the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally representative, these
data were combined with data from the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process was applied
to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in
the present file should be used to calculate estimates from the combined
cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate for independent analyses of
the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative results for
either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer
to the NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with
specific weights for that 2-year cycle. </p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017" target="_blank">2017-2018 </a>and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019" target="_blank">2019-2020 Laboratory Data Overview </a>documents
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants.
However, not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all
the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or
other population characteristics. For example, in 2017 - March 2020,
approximately 76% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC
provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age
18 and older provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of
missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary. </p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic Guidelines </a>and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">Tutorial</a> for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic
issues.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and
Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES
<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020" target="_blank">2017-March 2020 Pre-pandemic DemographicsFile</a>
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm" target="_blank">2017-March
2020 Pre-pandemic Fasting
Questionnaire File</a>
includes auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast and the
time of venipuncture.</p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES
data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>The detection
limit was constant for the analyte in the data set. Two variables are provided
for this analyte. The variable name ending in &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex., LBDHRPLC) indicates
whether the result was below the limit of detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that
the result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the
result was below the limit of detection. For the analyte with analytic results
below the lower limit of detection (LBDHRPLC=1), an imputed fill value was
placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection
divided by square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The variable prefixed LBX (ex.,
LBXHSCRP) provides the analytic result for that analyte.</p>
<p>The lower limit of
detection (LLOD, in mg/L) for High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein:</p>
