        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Nickel is a very
hard metal that occurs naturally in soils and volcanic dust (ATSDR, 2005).&nbsp; The essentiality of nickel has not been
proven in humans, though it has been for animal studies, while toxicity in
humans has been documented. Nickel can be introduced into the human body via consumption
of plants or supplements, degradation of metal-on-metal implants, and industrial
exposure. &nbsp;Contact with nickel can cause
allergic skin reactions; inhalation of nickel has been found to lead to asthma,
chronic bronchitis, and lung cancer; drinking water containing high levels of
nickel has been found to cause stomach, blood, and kidney issues.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third
subsample of examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>The method described in this document is for assessing multi-element
exposure by analyzing urine using inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS) (Tanner et al., 2002). This method
achieves rapid and accurate quantification of urinary chromium. This
method is used to screen urine when people are suspected to be acutely exposed
to these elements or to evaluate chronic environmental or other
non-occupational exposure (Quarles et al., 2014).</p>
<p>Liquid samples are
introduced into the ICP through a nebulizer and spray chamber carried by a
flowing argon stream. By coupling radio-frequency power into flowing argon, a
plasma is created in which the predominant species are positive argon ions and
electrons and has a temperature of 6000-8000 K. The sample passes through a
region of the plasma and the thermal energy atomizes the sample and then
ionizes the atoms. The ions, along with the argon, enter the mass spectrometer
through an interface that separates the ICP (at atmospheric pressure, ~760
torr) from the mass spectrometer (operating at a pressure of 10<sup>-7</sup>
torr). In the NexION&reg; ICP-MS, ions then pass through a focusing region, the Universal
Cell Technology (UCT), the quadrupole mass filter, and finally are counted in
rapid sequence at the detector allowing individual isotopes of an element to be
determined. </p>
<p>Refer to the
Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory
methods used. </p>
<p>There were no changes to the lab site or lab
equipment&nbsp;for this component in the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle. There were changes
to the lab method.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Urine samples are
processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National
Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, GA for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM)</a>.
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>. </p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs) </b></p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained. </p>
<p><b>Analytical
Laboratories </b></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens. </p>
<p>NCHS developed and
distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined
the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981) when running NHANES
specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping
or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data.
The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported results for
all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo; QA/QC performance criteria
for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al.,
2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018 Laboratory Data Overview</a>
for general information on NHANES laboratory data. </p>
<p>There are over 800
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the
dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables
used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item
non-response is necessary. </p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a>
and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial</a> for further details on the use of sample weights and
other analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Subsample Weights </b></p>
<p>The analytes included in this dataset were measured in
all examined participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special sample
weights are required to analyze these data properly. Variable (WTSA2YR)
encoding of the specific sample weights for this subsample is included in this
data file and should be used when analyzing these data. These special sample
weights were created to account for the subsample selection probability, as
well as the additional nonresponse to these lab tests. Therefore, if
participants were eligible for the subsample, but did not provide a urine
specimen, they would have the sample weight value assigned as &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their
records.<br />
<br />
<b>Demographic and Other Related Variables </b></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2017">NHANES
2017-2018 Demographics File</a> contains demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews
as well as the sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance
estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU,
respectively) in the demographic data file. </p>
<p>This laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN). </p>
<p>The variable
URXUCR (urine creatinine) will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be
found in the data file titled Albumin &amp; Creatinine &ndash; Urine. <br />
<br />
<b>Detection Limits </b><br />
</p>
<p>The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in
&ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex., URDUNILC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or above the limit of detection,
&ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other
variable prefixed URX (ex., URXUNI) provides the analytic result for that
analyte.&nbsp; For analytes with analytic
results below the lower limit of detection (ex., URDUNILC=1), an imputed fill
value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of
detection divided by square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). </p>
<p>The lower limit of
detection (LLOD, in &micro;g/L) for urinary nickel is: </p>
