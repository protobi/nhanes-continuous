        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program
suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020
cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally
representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined
with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative
sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to
the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the
use of the data.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Urinary
Perchlorate</span></strong></p>
<p>Perchlorate has
been used as an oxidant in solid fuel propellants for rockets and missiles
since the 1950s. Lesser amounts of perchlorate are used in matches and
fireworks. Perchlorate can also form naturally in the environment and can
accumulate in nitrate-rich mineral deposits mined for use in fertilizers.
Drinking water, milk, and certain plants with high water content (e.g.,
lettuce) can be the main sources of perchlorate intake for humans. Perchlorate
has been used medically to treat hyperthyroidism. Its inhibitory effect on
thyroid hormone production has led to concerns that exposure even to low levels
of perchlorate in the environment might affect vulnerable groups, such as
pregnant women with inadequate iodine intake and infants for whom thyroid
hormone levels must be maintained adequately for normal brain development.
Perchlorate taken into the body is rapidly eliminated in the urine, within a
matter of hours. Measurement of urinary perchlorate is useful to assess recent
human exposure.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Urinary Nitrate
and Thiocyanate</span></strong></p>
<p>Nitrate and
thiocyanate are polyatomic anions that can disrupt thyroid function by
competitively inhibiting iodide uptake, similar to the action of perchlorate.
Nitrate, thiocyanate, and perchlorate can reversibly bind to the sodium-iodide
symporter (NIS) protein resulting in reduced iodine absorption by the thyroid.
Nitrate, thiocyanate, and perchlorate interact additively to impair iodide
uptake by the thyroid. Therefore, assessment of the impact of perchlorate
exposure on thyroid function should include assessment of nitrate and
thiocyanate exposure. By assessing exposure to each of the three
physiologically relevant NIS-inhibitors, the relative impact of each chemical
on thyroid function can be estimated and appropriate regulatory action taken if
exposures are negatively impacting thyroid hormone levels. Impaired thyroid
function can lead to hypothyroidism, proliferative thyroid lesions, and
impaired neurodevelopment in infants.</p>
<p>Nitrate poisoning
can also lead to methemoglobinemia, primarily in infants. The prevalence of
nitrate exposure is likely due to nitrate intake from both food and drinking
water, with foods (e.g., vegetables, milk, dairy products) thought to account
for the majority of nitrate intake for typical American adults. Nitrate anion
can also form endogenously. Public health prevention efforts have reduced the
prevalence of methemoglobinemia in the United States. A reference range for
urinary nitrate will provide useful information relevant to nitrate poisoning
and subclinical methemoglobinemia in the U.S.</p>
<p>Thiocyanate is
also a biomarker of cyanide exposure from tobacco smoke or diet. Thiocyanate
primarily forms in the body as a metabolite of cyanide from tobacco smoke or
cyanogenic foods, such as cassava. Exposure to toxic levels of cyanide can
result from numerous chemical reactions. Lower levels of thiocyanate can also
be found in milk, dairy products, and some vegetables. Therefore, a defined
reference range for thiocyanate will provide useful benchmark data in case of a
cyanide exposure event.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third subsample of examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>This method is a
quantitative procedure for the measurement of nitrate, perchlorate, and
thiocyanate in human urine using ion chromatography coupled with electrospray
tandem mass spectrometry. Chromatographic separation is achieved using an
IonPac AS16 column with sodium hydroxide as the eluent. The eluent from the
column is ionized using an electrospray interface to generate and transmit
negative ions into the mass spectrometer. Comparison of relative response
factors (ratio of native analyte to stable isotope labeled internal standard)
with known standard concentrations yields individual analyte concentrations.</p>

Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory
methods used.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Urine specimens were
processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National
Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta GA for analysis. </p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf">2019-2020 NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual</a>.
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they were
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are
discussed in the NHANES LPM.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs)</strong></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques.
NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation
during visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical
Laboratories</strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et. al.,
1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC
procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported results for
all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo; QA/QC performance criteria
for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et. Al.,
2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19
pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020
after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020
sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because
the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally representative, these
data were combined with data from the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process was applied
to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in
the present file should be used to calculate estimates from the combined
cycles. The sample weights are not appropriate for independent analyses of the
2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative results for either
the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the
NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with
specific weights for that 2-year cycle. </p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018</a> and
<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019">2019-2020 Laboratory Data Overview</a> for
general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed.
The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the
dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables
used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item
non-response is necessary. </p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic
Guidelines</a> and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial</a> for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><strong>Subsample Weights</strong></p>
<p>Perchlorate,
nitrate, and thiocyanate in urine were measured in a one-third subsample of
participants 6 years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze
these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in
this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.</p>
<p>The analytes
included in this dataset were measured for all examined participants aged 3 to
5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6 years and older. For
participants aged 3 to 5 their WTSAPRP are equivalent to their MEC exam sample
weights. These participants have completed at least one physical exam component
in the MEC; therefore, they all have an exam sample weight larger than &ldquo;0,&rdquo;
regardless of their lab test results. For participants 6 years and older,
special sample weights were created for the subsample. These special weights
accounted for the additional probability of selection into the subsample, as
well as the additional nonresponse to these lab tests. Therefore, if
participant 6 years and older were selected as part of the one-third subsample,
but did not provide a urine specimen, they would have the sample weight value
assigned as &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their record.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and
Other Related Variables</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020">NHANES
2017-March 2020 Pre-Pandemic Demographic Data File</a> contains demographic data,
health indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews as well as the sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and
SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>This laboratory data
file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong></p>
<p>The detection
limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two variables are
provided for each of these analytes. The variable named ending in &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex.,
URDUP8LC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection: the
value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo;
indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other variable
prefixed URX (ex., URXUP8) provides the analytic result for that analyte. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex., URDUP8LC=1),
an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is
the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). </p>
<p><strong>The lower limits of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for urinary perchlorate,
nitrate, and thiocyanate: </strong></p>
