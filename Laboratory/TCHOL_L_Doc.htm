        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Heart
disease is the leading cause of death in the United States (Murphy, et. al.,
2018). Blood lipid levels are fundamental measures included in NHANES that can
be used for cardiovascular risk assessment. The goals the NHANES blood lipids
measurements include: 1) monitoring the prevalence and trends in major
cardiovascular conditions and overall risk factors in the U.S.; 2) evaluating
prevention and treatment programs targeting cardiovascular disease in the U.S.;
and 3) monitoring the status of hyperlipidemia.</p>
<p>In 2018,
new Blood Cholesterol Guidelines were released, by the American College of
Cardiology and American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice
Guidelines, which aim to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease through cholesterol management (Grundy, et. al., 2018). The blood
lipids measurements in NHANES include total cholesterol, high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
and triglycerides. The present file provides data on total cholesterol. Data on
LDL-C and triglycerides are provided in the Cholesterol &ndash; Low &ndash; Density
Lipoprotein and Triglycerides (TRIGLY_L) files, and HDL-C data are provided in
Cholesterol - High - Density Lipoprotein (HDL_L).</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined
participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p><strong>Total Cholesterol</strong></p>
<p>The
laboratory method used to measure total cholesterol is an enzymatic assay. In
this enzymatic assay, esterified cholesterol is converted to cholesterol by
cholesterol esterase. The resulting cholesterol is then acted upon by
cholesterol oxidase to produce cholest-4-en-3-one and hydrogen peroxide. The
hydrogen peroxide then reacts with 4-aminophenazone in the presence of
peroxidase to produce a colored product that is measured at 505 nm (secondary
wavelength = 700 nm). The final step is known as the Trinder reaction. This
method is a single reagent, endpoint reaction that is specific for cholesterol.</p>
<p>Cholesterol,
a steroid molecule with a hydroxyl group in the C3 position, is synthesized in
many types of tissue, but mainly in the liver and intestinal wall. About 75
percent of cholesterol is newly synthesized, with the remainder originating
from dietary intake. Cholesterol measurement is performed to screen for
atherosclerotic risk and in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving
elevated cholesterol as well as lipid and lipoprotein metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>Refer to
the Laboratory Method Files
section for a detailed description of the laboratory methods used.</p>
<p>Serum
total cholesterol levels were directly measured. Please see below the Data
Processing and Editing section for more details. For laboratory methods used
for LDL-C and triglycerides, and HDL-C, please refer to the accompanying documentation for the respective dataset.</p>
<p>There
were no changes to the lab method or lab site for this component in the NHANES August
2021-2023 cycle. However, the lab equipment used changed from the Cobas 6000
Analyzer to the Cobas 8000 during the cycle.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Serum
specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the University of Minnesota,
Minneapolis, MN for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2021-2023/manuals/2021-Laboratory-Procedures-508.pdf">NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manuals (LPM)</a>.
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they are
shipped to University of Minnesota for testing.</p>
<p>The
NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2021-2023/manuals/2021-Laboratory-Procedures-508.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</strong></p>
<p>Laboratory
team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical Laboratories</strong></p>
<p>NHANES
uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
specimens collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS
developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract laboratories,
which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et. al., 1981) when testing
NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are
submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in
the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of
concern.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data
were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p>
<p>One
derived variable was created in this data file. The variable was created using
the following formula:</p>
<p><strong>LBDTCSI</strong></p>
<p>The
total cholesterol in mg/dL (LBXTC) was converted to mmol/L (LBDTCSI) by
multiplying by 0.02586.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>There
are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not
all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the
dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables
used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item
non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please
refer to the NHANES&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic
Guidelines&nbsp;</a>and the
on-line NHANES&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial&nbsp;</a>for further details on the use
of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><strong>Phlebotomy Weights
<br />
<br />
</strong>For the August 2021-August 2023 cycle, analysis of nonresponse
patterns for the phlebotomy component in the MEC examination revealed
differences by age group and race/ethnicity, among other characteristics. For
example, approximately 67% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the
MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults
aged 18 and older provided a blood specimen. Therefore, an additional
phlebotomy weight, WTPH2YR, has been included in this data release to address
possible nonresponse bias. Participants
who are eligible but did not provide a blood specimen have their phlebotomy weight
assigned a value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records. The phlebotomy weight should be used for analyses
that use variables derived from blood analytes, and is included in all relevant
data files</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and Other Related Variables</strong></p>
<p>The
analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey
design and demographic variables. The&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2021">NHANES August
2021-August 2023 Demographics File</a>&nbsp;contains demographic data, health indicators, and
other related information collected during household interviews as well as the
sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation
requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively)
in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2021-2023/FASTQX_L.htm">&nbsp;Fasting
Questionnaire File&nbsp;i</a>ncludes auxiliary information, such
as fasting status, length of fast, and the time of venipuncture.</p>
<p>The
laboratory data file can be linked to other NHANES data file using the unique
survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong></p>
<p>The
detection limits were constant for this analyte in the data set.</p>

<p><strong>No Correction Need for Total Cholesterol
Results for NHANES August 2021 - August 2023</strong></p>
<strong>
</strong>
<p>A method validation (bridging) study was performed to compare results from
an instrument change in the August 2021-August 2023 cycle. The Cobas 6000 Chemistry
Analyzer was upgraded to the Cobas 8000 Chemistry Analyzer during the cycle. Randomly
selected serum samples (n=178) from previous NHANES were measured using both
instruments and the results were used to conduct the analysis. On average, serum
total cholesterol values measured from the Cobas 6000 were 0.56% higher than
values from the Cobas 8000 (p = 0.0001). Data from the bridging study indicated
the correlation coefficient (r) between the measurements was 0.998. Regression
analyses were performed using Analyse-it, v4.30.4. The weighted Deming
regression equation did not show a significant slope or intercept (95%
confidence interval [CI] for slope included 1 and for intercept included 0 [mg/L]):</p>
<p>Cobas 8000 = -0.985 + 1 * (Cobas 6000); 95% CI of slope (0.9909 to 1.009)
and intercept (-2.536 to 0.5662).</p>
<p>Therefore, the NHANES August 2021-August 2023 total cholesterol values did
not have to be adjusted.</p></div>
