        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the United States in the agricultural sector and the second most used in the home and garden market sector (U.S. EPA, 2017). Its use has increased more than 200-fold since 1974 when Monsanto commercialized it under the trade name Roundup (Benbrook, 2016). In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer determined that glyphosate is a &ldquo;probable human carcinogen&rdquo; (IARC, 2015). However, the European Food Safety Authority and the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Meeting on Pesticide Residues (EFSA, 2015; FAO/WHO, 2015) determined that glyphosate is unlikely to be a carcinogen. The U.S. EPA concluded that &ldquo;available data and weight-of-evidence clearly do not support the descriptors &ldquo;carcinogenic to humans,&rdquo; &ldquo;likely to be carcinogenic to humans,&rdquo; or &ldquo;inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential&rdquo; (U.S. EPA, 2017a). Controversy and concern that the rising use of glyphosate may have adverse human-health effects exist (Myers et. al., 2016). Yet, the extent of human exposure to glyphosate in the U.S. population is largely unknown. Data to better understand exposure to glyphosate are needed to increase our knowledge of its potential effects on health.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third subsample of examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>This method used 200 microliters of urine and was
based on 2D-on-line ion chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry
(IC- MS/MS) and isotope dilution quantification (Schutze et. al., 2021).</p>
<p>There were no changes to the lab method, lab
equipment, or lab site for this component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>The analytical measurements were conducted following strict quality control/quality assurance CLIA guidelines. Along with the study samples, each analytical run included high- and low-concentration quality control materials (QCMs) and reagent blanks to assure the accuracy and reliability of the data. The concentrations of the high-concentration QCMs and the low-concentration QCMs, averaged to obtain one measurement of high-concentration QCM and low-concentration QCM for each run, were evaluated using standard statistical probability rules (Caudill et. al., 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Data were received after all analyses were complete. The data were not edited. The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015">2015 &ndash; 2016 Laboratory Data Overview</a> for general information on
NHANES laboratory data. </p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory
tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided
biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. Additionally,
availability of specimens for surplus projects is lower than for other
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. The specimen availability
can also vary by age or other population characteristics. Analysts should
evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of
interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine
whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic Guidelines</a>&nbsp;and
the on-line&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">NHANES&nbsp;</a><a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">Tutorial</a>&nbsp;for further details
on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Subsample Weights</b></p>
<p>The analytes included in this dataset were
measured in all examined participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third
subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special
sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample
weights for this subsample, WTSSGL2Y, are included in this data file and should
be used when analyzing these data. The sample weights created for this file
used the examination sample weight, i.e., WTMEC2YR, as the base weight. The
base weight was adjusted for additional nonresponse to these lab tests and
re-poststratified to the population total using sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Participants who were part of the eligible population but
who did not provide a urine specimen, or did not have sufficient volume of biospecimens, or who did not give consent for their specimens to be used for
future research are included in the file, but they have a sample weight assigned &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and Other
Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be
conducted using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables.
The&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2015">NHANES 2015-2016
Demographics File</a>
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.</p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the
other NHANES data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e.,
SEQN).</p>
<p>The variable URXUCR (urine creatinine) will not
be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled &ldquo;Albumin
&amp; Creatinine &ndash; Urine&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>The detection limit was constant for all of the
analytes in the data set. Two variables are provided for each of these
analytes. The variable name ending in &ldquo;L&rdquo; (ex., SSGLYPL) indicates whether the
result was below the limit of detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result
was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result was below
the limit of detection. The other variable (ex., SSGLYP) provides the analytic
result for that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower
limit of detection (ex., SSGLYPL=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the
analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL)
for GLYP:</p>
