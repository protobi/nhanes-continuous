        <h5 class="specialnote">Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021 and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified. This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was modified to remove records (<5% of records) that were initially included in error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous file. However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries related to this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at serumplasmaurine@cdc.gov.</h5>

        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Soluble alpha-Klotho is a pleiotropic protein that act as a paracrine and endocrine hormonal factor in multiple organs. Decreased alpha-Klotho levels have been associated with early aging symptoms in animal models of aging. Determination of Klotho concentrations was performed on frozen NHANES 2011-2012 samples that were received and tested during the period 2019-2020. Analyses were performed by a commercially available ELISA kit produced by IBL International, Japan. </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Available pristine serum samples from 40-79 year old participants in NHANES 2011-2012 cycles, who gave consent for their samples to be used in future research, were analyzed with the IBL ELISA method.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>The Northwest Lipid Metabolism and Diabetes Research Laboratories, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology, and Nutrition, University of Washington, performed analyses on all but four fresh-frozen (pristine) samples received from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p>
<p>Prior to the start of the study, an
extensive validation of the IBL ELISA method for measurement of Klotho
concentration in human samples was performed and the results of the Validation
provided to the study investigators. </p>
<p>In summary, 1) the assay standard curves and the relative signals of the calibrator concentrations were consistently within the criteria specified by the manufacturer, 2) the obtained assay sensitivity was calculated to be 4.33 pg/mL while the manufacturer claimed sensitivity was 6.15 pg/mL, 3) two samples with very high and high Klotho concentrations were used at different dilution to evaluate the assay linearity. Plots of the expected vs. the obtained values, demonstrated an excellent linearity in the assay measurement range (R2 = 0.998 and 0.997, respectively), 4) the intra-assay precision obtained on two recombinant Klotho samples and two human samples exhibited a coefficient of variation of 3.2% and 3.9% for the recombinant and 2.3% and 3.3% for the human samples, 5) The same samples analyzed in duplicate over 4 different days, showed an inter-assay CV of 2.8% and 3.5% for the recombinant samples and 3.8% and 3.4% for the human samples, 5) the reference ranges were evaluated in 114 samples from apparently healthy donors and the alpha-Klotho levels ranged from 285.8 to 1638.6 pg/mL with a mean of 698.0 pg/mL.</p>
<p>All sample analyses were performed in
duplicate according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s protocol and all the results were
checked to meet the laboratory&rsquo;s standardized criteria for acceptability prior
to being released for reporting.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Samples were received on dry ice and
each package was inspected by the laboratory&rsquo;s receiving area personnel. Samples
were scanned, data compared with those on the received electronic manifest and
entered into the laboratory information system. All samples were stored at -80â—¦C
until predefined batches of samples were daily provided to the technicians for
analyses. </p>
<p>Samples were analyzed in duplicate and
the average of the two values used to calculate the final value.&nbsp;Two quality control samples with low and high
concentration of Klotho were also analyzed in duplicate in each ELISA plate. Results
of analyses were automatically transmitted from the instrument to the
laboratory Oracle Management System and results evaluated by the area
supervisor. Samples with duplicate results exceeding 10% were flagged for analyses
to be repeated. If the value of a quality control sample was not within the 2SD
of the assigned value, the entire analytical run was rejected, and sample
analyses repeated. </p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p><b>Demographic and Other Related Variables </b></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES 2011-2012 laboratory data must be
conducted using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES
Demographic Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other
related information collected during household interviews as well as the sample
design variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires
use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file. </p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b> </p>
<p>The assay sensitivity was 6 pg/mL. There
are&nbsp;no Klotho specific&nbsp;cut-points to be used as indicators of
biological age. The reference ranges evaluated in 114 samples from apparently
healthy donors indicated the alpha-Klotho levels ranged from 285.8 to 1638.6
pg/mL with a mean of 698.0 pg/mL.</p>
<p>Exam sample weights
should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic
Guidelines</a> and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/">Tutorial</a> for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p></div>
