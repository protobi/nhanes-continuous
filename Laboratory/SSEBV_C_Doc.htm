        <h5 class="specialnote">Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021 and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified. This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was modified to remove records (5-<10% of records) that were initially included in error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous file. However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries related to this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at serumplasmaurine@cdc.gov.</h5>

        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Among children ages 6-19 years who participated in NHANES between 2003 and 2004 and had stored serum samples available, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody testing was conducted. EBV VCA IgG antibody was measured using a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Surplus sera from children aged 6 to 19 years who participated in NHANES years 2003 to 2004.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>25 &mu;L of sample is required for each assay. Specimens, calibrators and controls are pre-diluted 1:21 prior to placing them in the test wells. Cut-off calibrator, controls and subject samples are diluted according to the specific test kit protocol, mixed briefly by vortex to assure good distribution of the sample in the diluent, and then transferred to the appropriately labeled wells and incubated. After washing the wells, conjugate is added with another incubation and wash step following. Substrate is added and allowed to incubate before the addition of stop/color reagent. The plates are read at an absorbance of 450 nm using a reference wavelength of 630 nm. EIA indices are calculated by hand using the formulas in the kit package insert. Data are recorded (1) as Positive (EIA index &ge; 1.10), Negative (EIA index &lt;0.90), or Equivocal (EIA index &ge; 0.90 to 1.09), and (2) as the exact numeric EIA index. The sensitivity of the assay is 96.6% and the specificity is 97.7%.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Data were submitted after all the antibody testing was complete. The data were not edited.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Commercial reagents were used for the EBV VCA IgG EIA antibody testing. All QA/QC procedures recommended by the manufacturer were followed. </p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The EIA indices have 4 categorical interpretations. <br />
1. Negative. These samples have an EIA index &lt;0.90. <br />
2. Positive. These samples have an EIA index &ge;1.10. <br />
3. Equivocal. These samples have an EIA index &ge; 0.90 to 1.099.* <br />
4. QNS. Quantity insufficient for testing. These samples were assigned an arbitrary index of missing.</p>
<p>*The only way to be certain if subjects with equivocal EIA antibody indices have been infected with EBV is to obtain another specimen from them. Since this is not practical and since this group is only a small fraction of the subjects tested (~0.05%), the cleanest approach to analyzing the data is to exclude them. </p></div>
