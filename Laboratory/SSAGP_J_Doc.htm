        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP; also called orosomucoid) is synthesized in
the liver and structurally belongs to the lipocalin superfamily of secretory
proteins, such as retinol-binding protein and &alpha;1-microglobulin. It is made up
of a polypeptide chain having 5 carbohydrate chains N-glycosidically bonded to
it (molar mass of 41,000 daltons). </p>
<p>
AGP is a sensitive acute phase reactant and its concentration can increase by a factor of 3 within 24-48 hours when inflammation occurs. It can also be used to differentiate between acute phase reactions (elevated serum level) and estrogen effects (normal or decreased serum level); whereas, the serum level of other positive reactants, such as ceruloplasmin and haptoglobin, increases during such reactions. Moderate and isolated increases occur when glomerular filtration is inhibited in the early stages of uremia. The determination is used in the assessment of the activity of acute and recurring inflammations as well as of tumors with cell necrosis (Schmid, 1975).</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined participants aged 1-5 years and females aged 12-49
years were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>The Tina-quant Roche AAGP2 assay is based on the principle of immunological agglutination. Anti-&alpha;1-acid glycoprotein antibodies react with antigen in the sample to form an antigen/antibody complex. Following agglutination, this is measured turbidimetrically (AAGP2 Tina-quant &alpha;1-Acid Glycoprotein Gen.2 [package insert]).</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>The laboratory and method were certified according to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (1988) guidelines (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment, 1988). Either in-house prepared serum quality control (QC) pools at three levels or Roche QC pools at two levels were analyzed in every run in duplicate and evaluated for validity against pre-established means and control limits by use of a multi-rule quality control program (Caudill et. al., 2008).</p>

<p>The method achieved satisfactory performance using the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) lyophilized human serum reference material ERM-DA470k, which has a certified AGP value of 0.617 g/L as measured by various methods using ERM-D470 as calibrant. The mean recovery of AGP in ERM-DA470k spiked into CFAS protein material was 96.8% (1:2 dilution), 94% (1:4 dilution), and 92.5% (1:8 dilution) during 2 measurements performed in 2020 and 2021. This procedure was adopted to avoid matrix effects that were observed when the reference material was diluted with Roche diluent, saline, or water and showed significant under-recovery.<br />
</p>
<p>The current project did not use pristine (never thawed) samples, because the laboratory showed that multiple freeze/thawing cycles do not cause a noticeable loss of AGP; and AGP can be assessed in residual serum as long as the specimens have been stored frozen at -70C. </p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Data were
received after all the laboratory testing was complete. The data were not
edited for extreme values.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018 Laboratory Data Overview</a>&nbsp;for
general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory
tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided
biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. Additionally,
availability of specimens for surplus projects is lower than for other
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. The specimen availability
can also vary by age or other population characteristics. Analysts should
evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of
interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine
whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/survey_methods.htm" target="_blank"> </a>and
the on-line NHANES <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/" target="_blank">Tutorial</a> for details on the
use of sample weights and analytic issues.</p>
<p><strong>Subsample Weights</strong></p>
<p>The analytes included in this dataset were
measured in a participants aged 1-5 years and females aged 12-49 years. Special
sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample
weights for this subsample, WTSSGP2Y, are included in this data file and should
be used when analyzing these data. The sample weights created for this file
used the examination sample weight, i.e., WTMEC2YR, as the base weight. The
base weight was adjusted for additional nonresponse to these lab tests and
re-poststratified to the population total using sex, age, and race/Hispanic origin. Participants who were part of the eligible population but
who did not provide a serum specimen, or did not have sufficient volume of biospecimens, or who did not give consent for their specimens to be used for
future research are included in the file, but they have a sample weight assigned &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and
Other Related Variables</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES
laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design and
demographic variables. The NHANES
<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2017">2017-2018 Demographics File</a> contains demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews
as well as the sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance
estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU,
respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>This laboratory data file can
be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey participant
identifier (i.e., SEQN). </p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits </strong><br />
<br />
The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. No
results were below the lower limit of detection. The lower limit of detection
(LLOD in g/L) for SSAGP:</p>
