        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>Flame retardants (FRs) are either additive or reactive ingredients
applied to household and consumer products to reduce the products flammability
and to meet state and federal fire safety standards and regulations. Until
recently, a dominant class of FR additives used for household products was
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are persistent and can accumulate
in the environment (de Wit, 2002; Law et. al., 2006; Stapleton et. al., 2012).
Flame retardant formulations containing chlorinated and non-chlorinated
organophosphates and non-PBDE brominated chemicals have entered consumers&rsquo;
markets as PBDEs have been phased-out in many countries (van der Veen and de
Boer, 2012). Several organophosphate aryl ester technical mixtures have been
increasingly used in residential applications. These mixtures contain isomers
of isopropylated and tert-butylated triarylphosphate esters, such as <a name="_Hlk122018626">isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate and tert-butylphenyl
diphenyl phosphate</a> (Phillips et. al., 2017). Additionally, human exposure
to these mixtures has been demonstrated to be widespread in several studies
(Hammel et. al., 2016; Phillips et. al., 2018). Biomarkers of exposure of
several flame retardants are quantified here, including
2-((isopropyl)phenyl)phenyl phosphate (iPPPP) and 4-((tert-butyl)phenyl)phenyl
phosphate (tBPPP), two metabolites of isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphates and
tert-butylphenyl diphenyl phosphates, respectively. </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and participants aged 6
years and older from a one-third subsample in the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic sample were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>The method uses 0.2 mL urine and is based on
enzymatic hydrolysis of urinary conjugates of the target analytes, automated
off-line solid phase extraction, reversed phase high-performance liquid
chromatography separation, and isotope dilution-electrospray ionization tandem
mass spectrometry detection (Jayatilaka et. al., 2019).</p>
<p>There were no changes to the lab method, lab
equipment, or lab site for this component in the NHANES 2017-March 2020
cycle.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>The analytical measurements were conducted
following strict quality control/quality assurance CLIA guidelines. Along with
the study samples, each analytical run included high- and low-concentration
quality control materials (QCMs) and reagent blanks to assure the accuracy and
reliability of the data. The concentrations of the high-concentration QCMs and
the low-concentration QCMs, averaged to obtain one measurement of
high-concentration QCM and low-concentration QCM for each run, were evaluated
using standard statistical probability rules (Caudill et. al., 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Data were received after all analyses were
complete. The data were not edited. The data were reviewed.
Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory for
confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic required
suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020 after data were
collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020 sample. Data
collection was cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because the collected
data from 18 locations were not nationally representative, these data were
combined with data from surplus specimens from the previous cycle (2017-2018)
to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process
was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting sample
weights in the present file should be used to calculate estimates from the
combined cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate for independent analyses
of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative results for
either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer
to the NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with
specific weights for that 2-year cycle.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019">2019-2020</a> Laboratory Data Overviews&nbsp;for
general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory
tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided
biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. Additionally,
availability of specimens for surplus projects is lower than for other
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. The specimen availability
can also vary by age or other population characteristics. Analysts should
evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of
interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine
whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic Guidelines </a>and the on-line NHANES <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/" target="_blank">Tutorial</a> for details on the use of sample weights and analytic
issues.</p>
<p><strong>Subsample Weights</strong></p>
<p>The analytes included in this dataset were
measured in all examined participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third
subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special
sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample
weights for this subsample, WTSSBPP, are included in this data file and should be
used when analyzing these data. The sample weights created for this file used
the examination sample weight, i.e., WTMECPRP, as the base weight. The base
weight was adjusted for additional nonresponse to these lab tests and
re-poststratified to the population total using sex, age, and race/Hispanic
origin. Participants who were part of the
eligible population but did not provide a urine specimen, or did not have
sufficient volume of biospecimens, or who did not give consent for their specimens to be used for
future research are included in the file; however, they have a sample weight assigned &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and Other
Related Variables</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be
conducted using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables.
The&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020">NHANES 2017-March 2020 Pre-Pandemic Demographics File</a> contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the
other NHANES data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e.,
SEQN).</p>
<p>The variable URXUCR (urine creatinine) will not
be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled &ldquo;Albumin
&amp; Creatinine &ndash; Urine&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong></p>
<p>The detection limit was constant for all of the
analytes in the data set. Two variables are provided for each of these
analytes. The variable name ending in &ldquo;L&rdquo; (ex., SSIPPPL) indicates whether the
result was below the limit of detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result
was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result was below
the limit of detection. The other variable (ex., SSIPPP) provides the analytic
result for that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower
limit of detection (ex., SSIPPPL=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the
analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). All data are rounded to three
significant figures or three decimal places, whichever is less precise.</p>
<p>The
lower limits of detection (LLOD, in &micro;g/mL)
for SSIPPP and SSBPPP:</p>
