        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program suspended field
operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not
completed and the collected data are not nationally representative.
Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from
the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public.
Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the
data.</p>
<p>A urine pregnancy
test was performed on menstruating female survey participants 8 years and
older. All positive test results were used to exclude pregnant women from the Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry component at the mobile examination center (MEC).</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined female
participants aged 12&ndash;59 years, and menstruating females aged 8&ndash;11 years,
in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample, were eligible. However, due to disclosure risks, only females 20-44 years of
age have urine pregnancy results in this file.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>The Icon 25 hCG
test kit (Beckman Coulter) is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the
qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine or serum
to aid in the early detection of pregnancy. The test utilizes a combination of
monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to selectively detect elevated levels of
hCG in urine or serum.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Urine specimens
were processed in the NHANES mobile examination centers.</p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf" target="_blank">2017-2018 </a>and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf" target="_blank">2019-2020 NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manuals</a>
(LPMs). </p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the NHANES LPMs.</p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19
pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020
after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020
sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because
the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally representative, these
data were combined with data from the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process was applied
to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in
the present file should be used to calculate estimates from the combined
cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate for independent analyses of
the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative results for
either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer
to the NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with
specific weights for that 2-year cycle. </p>

documents for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the
dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables
used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item
non-response is necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic
Guidelines </a>and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">Tutorial</a> for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and
Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020" target="_blank">NHANES2017-March 2020 Pre-pandemic Demographics File </a>contains demographic
data, health indicators, and other related information collected during
household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The recommended
procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables
(SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file. </p>
<p>This laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN). </p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>Since this data is
reported as qualitative data, the use of lower LLOD is not applicable.</p></div>
