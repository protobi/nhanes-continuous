        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from surplus urine samples from the NHANES 2017-2018
cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic
data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic
Notes section for more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>Assessing human benzene exposure is of public health significance. Exposure is associated with leukemia and other numerous health risks (Bahadar et. al., 2014; Smith, 2010), and people may be exposed to benzene from numerous sources, including tobacco smoke (Smith, 2010; Talhout et. al., 2006), e-cigarette aerosol (Behar et. al., 2018; Pankow et. al., 2017), automobile exhaust, and industrial applications (Smith, 2010). </p>
<p>VOCs can be metabolized prior to urinary excretion, so VOC exposure can be assessed by measuring their urine metabolites. An analytical method was developed to measure metabolites of benzene (trans,trans-Muconic acid [URXMUCA]; N-Acetyl-S-phenyl-L-cysteine [URXPHMA]), which will greatly improve our understanding of the extent of exposure to these selected VOCs.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third subsample in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>This method is a quantitative procedure to measure urinary metabolites of benzene using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Sample preparation involves 1:10 dilution of 50 &micro;L urine samples in ammonium formate buffer, pH 2.9. Chromatographic separation of each prepared urine specimen is achieved by using a Waters Acquity UPLC HSS fluoro-phenyl (PFP) column using a mobile phase A (0.02% formic acid) and a mobile phase B (methanol). The eluate from the column is ionized using electrospray ionization, which is used to generate and transmit ions into the mass spectrometer. Comparison of relative response factors (ratio of native analyte to stable isotope-labeled internal standard) with known standard concentrations yields individual analyte concentrations in each sample (Bhandari et. al., 2019).&nbsp; </p>
<p>The VOC Metabolites II dataset was produced by applying an improved method
for measuring N-Acetyl-S-phenyl-L-cysteine (PHMA). NHANES cycle 2015-2016 and
prior measured PHMA (NHANES variable URXPMA, dataset UVOC_I) in urine samples
at neutral pH. Conversely, NHANES cycle 2017-March 2020 measured PHMA (NHANES
variable URXPHMA) in urine samples prepared at pH 2.9. This acid treatment
converts the PHMA precursor, i.e., pre-PHMA to PHMA; thus the new method
quantifies both free PHMA and PHMA formed from the acid dehydration of pre-PHMA
(Bhandari et. al., 2019). This new PHMA measure more accurately assesses
benzene exposure (Sterz et. al., 2010). The PHMA results reported from NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data (URXPHMA) should not be directly compared to PHMA (URXPMA) reported in previous NHANES analyses (Tevis et. al., 2020). </p>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Urine specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta GA for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are
discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">2017-2018</a>

Procedures Manuals (LPM). Vials are stored under
appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they are shipped to National Center
for Environmental Health for testing. </p>
<p>The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet
the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.</p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is
monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a
structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the
quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each laboratory staff
member is observed for equipment operation, specimen collection and
preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are given to each
staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that
required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the
quality of the analyses performed by the CDC and contract laboratories. In the
MEC, these methods include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry
run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat
testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for
all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard,
et al., 1981) when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures recommended by the
manufacturers were followed. Reported results for all assays meet the Division
of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo; QA/QC performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al., 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data
were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic required
suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020 after data were
collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020 sample. Data
collection was cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because the collected
data from 18 locations were not nationally representative, these data were
combined with data from surplus specimens from the previous cycle (2017-2018)
to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process
was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting sample
weights in the present file should be used to calculate estimates from the
combined cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate for independent
analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative
results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone.
Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use
data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019">2019-2020 Laboratory Data Overviews</a>&nbsp;for
general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory
tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided
biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. Additionally,
availability of specimens for surplus projects is lower than for other
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. The specimen availability
can also vary by age or other population characteristics. Analysts should
evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of
interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine
whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/survey_methods.htm" target="_blank"> </a>and the on-line NHANES <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/" target="_blank">Tutorial</a> for details on the use of sample weights and analytic
issues.</p>
<p><b>Subsample Weights</b></p>
<p>The analytes included in this dataset were
measured in all examined participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third
subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special
sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample
weights for this subsample, WTVOC2PP, are included in this data file and should
be used when analyzing these data. The sample weights created for this file
used the examination sample weight, i.e., WTMECPRP, as the base weight. The
base weight was adjusted for additional nonresponse to these lab tests and
re-poststratified to the population total using sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Participants who were part of the eligible population but
who did not provide a urine specimen, or did not have sufficient volume of biospecimens, or who did not give consent for their specimens to be used for
future research (for 2017-2018) are included in the file but they have a sample weight assigned &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and
Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES
laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design and
demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020">NHANES
2017-March 2020 Pre-Pandemic Demographics File</a> contains demographic
data, health indicators, and other related information collected during
household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The recommended
procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables
(SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>This laboratory data file can
be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey participant
identifier (i.e., SEQN). </p>
<p>Starting in the 2015-2016
NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine) will not be reported in
this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled &ldquo;Albumin &amp;
Creatinine &ndash; Urine&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits </b><br />
<br />
The detection limits were constant for the analytes in
the data set. Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The
variable named ending in &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex., URDPMALC) indicates whether the result was
below the limit of detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or
above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result was below the limit
of detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., URDPMALC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square
root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXPHMA)
provides the analytic result for the analyte. All data are rounded to three
significant figures or three decimal places, whichever is less precise.</p>
<p>The lower limit of detection
(LLOD, in ng/mL) for URXMUCA and URXPHMA:</p>
