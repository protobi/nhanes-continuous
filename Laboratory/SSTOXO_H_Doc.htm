        <h5 class="specialnote">Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021 and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified. This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was modified to remove records (<5% of records) that were initially included in error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous file. However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries related to this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at serumplasmaurine@cdc.gov.</h5>

        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Sera from residual
specimens from NHANES 2013-2014 participants were tested for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Toxoplasma gondii</i> by an enzyme
immunoassay (EIA) that detects IgG and IgM antibodies against <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">T. gondii</i>. The results for the
Toxoplasma IgG in this data release are reported as IU/ml. Samples with results
&ge; 33 IU/mL should be coded as Positive, samples with results &lt; 27 IU/mL
should be coded as Negative, and samples with results &ge; 27 IU/mL and &lt;33
IU/mL were considered Equivocal. The Toxoplasma IgM results are reported as
Ratio values. Sample Ratio &lt; 0.8 are coded as Negative, Sample Ratio &ge; 0.8
&lt; 1 are coded as Equivocal, and Sample Ratio &ge; 1 are coded Positive. All
results originally considered Equivocal were repeated at least twice for
confirmation and should be coded as Negative.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">To complement the
detection of anti-toxoplasma IgG and IgM the VIDAS Toxo-IgG Avidity assay was
performed on the samples that coded positive for both IgG and IgM. Samples with
results &lt;20 are coded Low, samples &ge;20 and &lt;30 are coded Equivocal, and
samples &ge;30 are coded High.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Participants age
6+ who consented to storing their samples for future research and had stored
samples from 2013-2014. As required by the NCHS ERB, Toxoplasma IgM testing was
excluded for women pregnant at the time of the MEC examination and within 1
year previously.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;"><i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> IgG and IgM antibodies were measured with two enzyme immunoassay kits
(Bio-Rad, Redmond, WA). The Toxoplasma IgG EIA test utilizes antigen-coated wells.
The samples are incubated in the antigen-coated wells, (if present) <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">T. gondii</i> antibodies are immobilized in
the wells. Residual sample is eliminated by washing and conjugate (enzyme
labeled antibodies to human IgG) is added and incubated. If IgG antibodies to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">T. gondii</i> are present, the conjugate
will be immobilized in the wells. Residual conjugate is eliminated by washing
and the substrate is added. In the presence of the enzyme, the substrate is
converted to a yellow end product which is read photometrically. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The Platelia Toxo
IgM test utilizes an immunoenzymatic double sandwich method. The samples are
incubated in the anti-human IgM coated wells. The IgM antibodies, if present,
are captured by the solid phase. Remaining antibodies and residual sample are
removed by washing. A solution containing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">T.
gondii</i> antigen and conjugate (monoclonal antibody to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">T. gondii</i> labeled with HRP) is added to the wells. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">T. gondii</i> IgM antibodies in the sample
that are captured on the wells bind the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">T.
gondii </i>antigen-complex. Excess <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">T.
gondii</i> antigen and conjugate are removed by washing and the substrate is
added. In the presence of the enzyme, the substrate is converted to a yellow
end product which is read photometrically.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Optical density
was determined on a vMax microplate reader and computer equipped with SOFTmax
software (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA). </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Quality control
samples are included on every plate. The results of serologic tests are of
value as presumptive evidence of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">T.
gondii</i> infection. The test results are objective and normalized as index
values, International Units (IU/mL), which are traceable to the WHO
Anti-Toxoplasma Serum, 3rd International Standard Preparation, 1994. Prior to
the study the Toxoplasma IgG EIA was evaluated using an established serum panel
and comparison with the CDC Toxoplasma immunofluorescence assay and the
Sabin-Feldman dye test and found to have a sensitivity and specificity of 100%.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The avidity test was
performed on samples positive for both Toxoplasma IgG and IgM by Palo Alto
Medical Foundation utilizing the VIDAS&reg; TOXO IgG Avidity (TXGA) kit. The VIDAS&reg;
TOXO IgG Avidity assay is an automated qualitative test for the determination
of anti-Toxoplasma IgG avidity in human serum using the ELFA technique (Enzyme
Linked Fluorescent Assay). The assay is intended for use in conjunction with
results from the VIDAS TOXO IgG II and must have a positive titer &ge; 8 IU/mL. Samples
with an index (ratio of high avidity antibodies to total IgG antibodies;
numbers represent percent) of &lt;20 are coded as Low avidity, samples &ge;20 but
&lt;30 are coded Equivocal, and samples &ge;30 are coded High avidity. </p><h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The <i>Toxoplasma
gondii </i>EIA test is considered in control provided the quality control serum
is within two standard deviations of its mean.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Data was compiled
after all the antibody testing was completed. The data were not edited.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Data Access: All
data are publicly available.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Results were
measured as IU/ml for Toxoplasma IgG. Samples with results &ge; 33 IU/mL should be
coded as Positive, samples with results &lt; 27 IU/mL should be coded as
Negative, and samples with results &ge; 27 IU/mL and &lt;33 IU/mL were considered
Equivocal. All results originally considered Equivocal were repeated at least
twice for confirmation and should be coded as Negative.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Results were
measured as Sample Ratio for Toxoplasma IgM. Sample Ratio &lt; 0.8 are coded as
Negative, Sample Ratio &ge; 0.8 &lt; 1 are coded as Equivocal, and Sample Ratio &ge;
1 are coded Positive. All results originally considered Equivocal were repeated
at least twice for confirmation and should be coded as Negative. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Toxoplasma gondii</i> IgM antibodies<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span>can persist for several months to years after acute
infection, and false-positive tests occur, therefore Toxoplasma
IgM tests have limited use in determining the timing or incidence of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">T. gondii</i> infection. </p></div>
