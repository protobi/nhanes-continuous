        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Polybrominated
diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 2,2&rsquo;,4,4&rsquo;,5,5&rsquo;-hexabromobiphenyl (PBB-153) are
included in a larger group of chemicals known as brominated flame retardants
(BFRs) that are added to products, such as foam padding, textiles, or
plastics&nbsp;to prevent accidental ignition and fire development. BFRs are not
chemically bound to the flame-retarded material, so they can enter the
environment from volatilization, leaching, or degradation of BFR-containing
products. PBDEs are generally persistent in the environment and have been
measured in aquatic sediments, house dust, and aquatic and terrestrial animals.
PBDEs have been shown to bio accumulate in fish. Humans may be exposed through
diet, including breastfeeding, and by contact with BFR-treated products and contaminated
house dust.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Examined participants

NHANES 2015-2016 were stored frozen before analysis. Eleven polybrominated
diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and PBB-153 (Table 1) were measured in serum using automated
liquid-liquid extraction and subsequent sample clean-up. Final determination of
target analytes was performed by isotope dilution gas chromatography
high-resolution mass spectrometry GC/IDHRMS. The analytical method is described
in Jones et al., 2012, which is a modification of the method described by
Sjodin et al., 2004. </p>

Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the quality control procedures. Each laboratory staff member
is observed for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation;
testing procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member.
Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill
levels were maintained.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;"><b>Analytical Laboratories</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods
include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol
for all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules
(Westgard, et al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports
containing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens,
summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration,
reagents, and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The
reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are
required to explain any identified areas of concern.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were
followed. Reported results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory
Sciences&rsquo; quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).
</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The data were

Analytic Guidelines </a>and the on-line <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/" target="_blank">NHANES Tutorial </a>for details on the use of sample
weights and analytic issues.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;"><b>Subsample
Weights</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">PBDEs and PBB-153 were measured in a one-third subsample
of participants 12 years and older.&nbsp;Special sample weights are required to
analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are
included in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Samples were
pooled in groups of 8 samples per pool within 48 demographic groups. The
analysis of NHANES 2015-2016 pooled-sample data must be conducted with the
basic demographic variables provided in this data file. This pooled-sample data
file cannot be linked to other NHANES 2015-2016 data. Because each sample person
does not have an equal probability of selection, sample weighting is needed to
produce correct population estimates of means, percentiles, and other
descriptive statistics. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The pooled-sample
weights required to produce estimates from these data are included in this data
file. The analysis of pooled-samples from survey data is a relatively new field
of study, and there is currently no established method to produce design effect
adjusted variance estimates for these pooled results.&nbsp;These data cannot be
analyzed using software designed for complex surveys because design features
are not available.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;"><b>Rationale and
Methods Used to Create Pooled Results</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides an ongoing assessment of the U.S.
population's exposure to environmental chemicals by using biomonitoring in
conjunction with CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES). Characterizing the distributions of concentrations of environmental
compounds or their metabolites in the U.S. population is a primary objective of
CDC's biomonitoring program. Historically, this characterization has been based
on individual measurements of these compounds in body fluid or tissue from
representative samples of the population. Pooling samples allows for larger
sample volumes, which can result in lower limits of detection and
reduces the number of measurements and costs.&nbsp;In NHANES 2015-2016, a
weighted pooled-sample design was implemented to facilitate pooling samples
before making analytical measurements. Table 1 lists the International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) names, common abbreviation, and NHANES
variable name for the analytes included in this data file.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">Pools were prepared from&nbsp;serum collected from a
random one-third subsample of the NHANES 2015-2016 participants aged 12 years
and older. Samples were pooled based on gender, race and Hispanic origin, and
age. To implement the pooled-sample design, each participant sample was
identified as belonging to one of 48 demographic groups based on race and
Hispanic origin (Mexican American: MA, Other Hispanic: OH, non-Hispanic white:
NHW, non-Hispanic black: NHB, non-Hispanic Asian: NHA, Other race including
multiracial: OTHER), gender (Male, Female), and age group (12-19, 20-39, 40-59,
and 60+ years of age and older). Eight (8) samples were included in each pool.
The number of pools created for each of the 48 demographic groups varied
depending on the total number of individual samples available in a demographic
group. The one-third subsample of NHANES 2015-2016 represents 2,133 individual
samples, but because the pooled-sample design requires that all samples be of
sufficient volume and that there be the same number of samples in each pool, 1,989
samples were available to create 265 pools with 8 samples per pool. Data user
needs to be cautious when making national inference including this population
subgroup.&nbsp; See more details on pool
sample formation and exceptions in Table 2. The variable SAMPLEID denotes the identification
number for each pool and ranges from 1 through 265.

information on individual participants included in each pool.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">In order to
incorporate sample weighting into the pooled-sample design it was necessary to
use a different volume of material from each sample contributing to a pool. The
volume chosen for each sample in a pool was based on the ratio of its sampling
weight to the sum of the sampling weights of all samples in the pool. To
physically accomplish the pooling in the laboratory required that the ratio of
the largest to the smallest sampling weight of samples in the same pool be no
larger than about 10. The individual samples were sorted/stratified by sampling
weight within each of the 48 demographic groups and pools were formed using
samples with sampling weights adjacent to one another in the sorted list. The
number of samples in the one-third subsample, number of samples available, the
number of these samples that were usable, and the number of pools formed in
each demographic group are presented in Table 2. Once the pools were created,
summed sampling weights were further adjusted to account for the unused
samples. These adjusted summed sampling weights are represented by the variable
named WTBSMSMA.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2015">NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics File</a>
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2015-2016/fastqx_i.htm">Fasting
Questionnaire File</a> includes auxiliary information, such as fasting
status, length of fast, and the time of venipuncture. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES
data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;"><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: 15.95pt;">In the dataset,
the whole-weight detection limit (pg/g serum) is a variable and dependent on
the available sample size; however, the variation in sample size was low. Lipid-adjusted
detection limits are variable (ng/g lipid) due to differences of the lipid
levels measured in individual pools/specimens. In cases where the result was
below the limit of detection, the value for that variable is the detection
limit divided by the square root of 2.</p>

<p><b>Methodological approaches
for analysis </b></p>
<p>There are a few
pooled-sample methodological publications, which address approaches related to
the following topics:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; direction: ltr;">
    <li>
    Variance estimation and bias correction
    when pooling samples from log-normally distributed populations (Caudill, 2010a;
    Caudill, 2010b; Caudill et al., 2007; Li et al., 2014; Mary-Huard et al., 2007);
    </li>
    <li>
    Models that incorporate measurement
    error when analyzing pooled-samples from normally or log-normally distributed
    populations (Caudill, 2010a; Caudill, 2015);
    </li>
    <li>
    Incorporation of sample weighting into
    a pooled-sample design (Caudill, 2012; Caudill, 2010a); and
    </li>
    <li>
    Estimation of standard errors and
    confidence limits for point estimates from pooled-samples (Caudill, 2012;
    Caudill, 2010a).&nbsp;
