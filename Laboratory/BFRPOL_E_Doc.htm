2,2&rsquo;,4,4&rsquo;,5,5&rsquo;-hexabromobiphenyl (PBB-153) are included in a larger group of
chemicals known as brominated flame retardants (BFRs) that are added to
products such as foam padding, textiles, or plastics&nbsp;to prevent accidental
ignition and fire development. BFRs are not chemically bound to the
flame-retarded material, so they can enter the environment from volatilization,
leaching, or degradation of BFR-containing products. PBDEs are generally
persistent in the environment and have been measured in aquatic sediments,
house dust, and aquatic and terrestrial animals. PBDEs have been shown to bio
accumulate in fish. Humans may be exposed though the diet, including breast
feeding, and by contact with BFR-treated products and contaminated house dust.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a

were measured in serum through the use of automated liquid/liquid extraction
and subsequent sample clean-up. Final determination of target analytes was
performed by isotope dilution gas chromatography high-resolution mass
spectrometry GC/IDHRMS. The analytical method is described in Jones et al,
2012, which is a modification of the method described by Sjodin et al., 2004. </p>

<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency assessment
evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work
and the quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed
for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing
procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels
were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods
include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol
for all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules
(Westgard,
et al. 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were
followed. Reported results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory
Sciences&rsquo; quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al. 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were

use of sample weights and analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Subsample Weights</b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The original pooled-sample weight created for this file released in July 2013
did not accurately take into account the new sample design for this NHANES
survey cycle and it was not correctly stratified to the U.S. population
total.&nbsp; This new file contains the corrected sample weight
(WTSMSMPA).&nbsp; The corrected sample weight was created so that analyses
using race and Hispanic origin would be comparable to the three groups used in
NHANES 2005-2006 (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black and Mexican-American).&nbsp;
Therefore, analyses of the data for &rdquo;Total Hispanics&rdquo; is not appropriate. No
changes or corrections were made to the lab analyte data in this new
release.&nbsp; Any analyses of the data using the old public use data file
should be repeated using the corrected sample weight on this new file.</p>
<p>PBDEs and PBB-153 were measured in a one third subsample
of persons 12 years and over, and samples were pooled in groups of 8 samples
per pool within 32 demographic groups. The analysis of NHANES 2007-2008
pooled-sample data must be conducted with the basic demographic variables
provided in this data file. This pooled-sample data file cannot be linked to
other NHANES 2007-2008 data. &nbsp;Because each sample person does not have an
equal probability of selection, sample weighting is needed to produce correct
population estimates of means, percentiles, and other descriptive statistics. </p>
<p>The pooled-sample weights required to produce estimates
from these data are included in this data file.&nbsp; The analysis of
pooled-samples from survey data is a relatively new field of study, and there
is currently no established method to produce variance estimates for these
pooled results.&nbsp;&nbsp; These data cannot be analyzed using software
designed for complex surveys because design features are not available.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Demographic and Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using
the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2007" target="_blank">NHANES
2007-2008 Demographics</a>&nbsp;File contains demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews
as well as the sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance
estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU,
respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Laboratory&amp;CycleBeginYear=2007" target="_blank">Fasting
Questionnaire File</a>&nbsp;includes auxiliary information, such as
fasting status, length of fast and the time of venipuncture. </p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES
data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><b>Rationale and Methods Used to Create Pooled Results</b></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
provides an ongoing assessment of the US population's exposure to environmental
chemicals by using biomonitoring in conjunction with CDC's National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Characterizing the distributions of
concentrations of environmental compounds or their metabolites in the US
population is a primary objective of CDC's biomonitoring program. Historically,
this characterization has been based on individual measurements of these
compounds in body fluid or tissue from representative samples of the
population. Pooling samples allows for larger sample volumes which can result
in lower limits of detection and reduces the number of measurements and
costs.&nbsp;In NHANES 2007-2008, a weighted pooled-sample design was
implemented to facilitate pooling samples before making analytical
measurements. Table 1 lists the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry (IUPAC) names, common abbreviation, and NHANES variable name for the
analytes included in this data file.</p>
<p>Pools were
prepared from&nbsp;serum collected from a random one-third subset of the NHANES
2007-2008 participants aged 12 years and older. Samples were pooled based on
gender, race and Hispanic origin, and age. To implement the pooled-sample
design, each participant sample was identified as belonging to one of 32
demographic groups based on race and Hispanic origin&nbsp;(non-Hispanic white:
NHW,&nbsp;non-Hispanic black: NHB, Mexican American: MA,&nbsp;not non-Hispanic
black,&nbsp;non-Hispanic white:or Mexican American: OTHER), gender (Male,
Female), and age group (12-19, 20-39, 40-59, and 60+ years of age and older).
Eight (8) samples were included in each pool. The number of pools created for
each of the 32 demographic groups varied depending on the total number of
individual samples available in a demographic group. The one-third subset of
NHANES 2007-2008 represents 2282 individual samples, but because the
pooled-sample design requires that all samples be of sufficient volume and that
there be the same number of samples in each pool, only 2070 samples were
available to create 264 pools with 8 samples per pool. &nbsp;See more details on pool sample formation and
exceptions in Table 2. The variable SAMPLEID denotes the identification number for each pool and ranges from 1 through 260. Please refer to the
Pooled-Sample Technical Support file (POOLTF_E) for detailed information on
individual participants included in each pool.</p>
<p>In order to incorporate sample weighting into the
pooled-sample design it was necessary to use a different volume of material
from each sample contributing to a pool. The volume chosen for each sample in a
pool was based on the ratio of its sampling weight to the sum of the sampling
weights of all samples in the pool. To physically accomplish the pooling in the
laboratory required that the ratio of the largest to the smallest sampling
weight of samples in the same pool be no larger than about 4 or 5. The individual
samples were sorted/stratified by sampling weight within each of the 32
demographic groups and pools were formed using samples with sampling weights
adjacent to one another in the sorted list. The number of samples in the
one-third subset, number of samples available, the number of these samples that
were usable, and the number of pools formed in each demographic group are
presented in Table 2. Once the pools were created, summed sampling weights were
further adjusted to account for the unused samples. These adjusted summed
sampling weights are represented by the variable named WTSMSMPA.</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>In the dataset, the whole weight detection limit (pg/g
serum) is a variable and dependent on the available sample size, however, the
variation in sample size was low. Lipid adjusted detection
limits are variable (ng/g lipid) due to differences of the lipid levels
measured in individual pools/specimens. In cases where the result was below the
limit of detection, the value for that variable is the detection limit divided
by the square root of 2.</p>
