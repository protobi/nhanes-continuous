        <h5 class="specialnote">Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021 and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified. This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was modified to remove records (10-<15% of records) that were initially included in error. No data values were altered. However, survey weights were newly created. For each analyte included in this data file, it was determined that overall and for stratified sex, age, and race/Hispanic origin groups, the updated file using the new sample weights resulted in an estimate within the 95% confidence limit calculated using the original file and sample weights.  However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries related to this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at serumplasmaurine@cdc.gov.</h5>

        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Creatinine correction is the most commonly used method to compensate for variation in urine dilution when urinary biomarker is analyzed. However, in some case, Specific Gravity (SG), or the combination of SG and creatinine was found to be more appropriate. In this study, the potential value of using SG, and both SG and creatinine will be investigated. The primary goal was to find if a correlation exists between uncorrected, creatinine-corrected, SG-corrected, and both creatinine- and SG-corrected urinary NNAL and serum cotinine, and which value showed the strongest correlation. Another goal was to determine the best method of correcting NNAL to account for variability in interpersonal urine concentrations in NHANES samples using creatinine and SG as normalizing factors both independently and simultaneously.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>The eligible samples are those that have adequate volume after NNAL assay. All participants aged 6 years and older from NHANES 2007-2008 were subjected to NNAL assay.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>SG will be measure by a digital hand-held refractometer ATAGO PAL-10S, with automatic temperature compensation. This refractometer has been validated before and has been used for other project. The measurement of urine SG is rather simple: place approximately 0.3 ml of well-mixed urine sample onto the prism surface and press the START key. The measurement will be displayed on the screen. The refractometer will be set to zero with HPLC water once for each run. Since there are 24 samples in each run, the refractometer will be auto-zeroed every 24 samples.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Data was received after all the SG measurements were complete. The data were not edited.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>One blank and one QC were measured in each run. All final reported data were from runs confirmed to be within statistical control limits using the multi-rule quality control system implemented in the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, CDC.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>There is only one variable: SSUSG, specific gravity measured on the refractometer ATAGO PAL-10S. <strong>Specific gravity</strong> is the ratio of the density (mass of a unit volume) of a substance (urine) to the density (mass of the same unit volume) of a reference substance (water).</p>
<p><strong>Subsample Weights </strong></p>
<p>Sample
weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights
for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used when
analyzing these data. When observations were removed from this data file, a new
sample weight was created and added to this data file (WTSSUG2Y). Please refer
to the NHANES&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic
Guidelines</a>&nbsp;and the on-line&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">NHANES&nbsp;</a><a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">Tutorial</a>&nbsp;for
