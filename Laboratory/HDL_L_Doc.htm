        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Heart disease is
the leading cause of death in the United States (Murphy, et. al., 2018). Blood
lipid levels are fundamental measures included in NHANES that can be used for
cardiovascular risk assessment. The goals of the NHANES blood lipids
measurements include: 1) monitoring the prevalence and trends in major
cardiovascular conditions and overall risk factors in the U.S.; 2) evaluating
prevention and treatment programs targeting cardiovascular disease in the U.S.;
and 3) monitoring the status of hyperlipidemia.</p>
<p>In 2018, new Blood
Cholesterol Guidelines were released by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Task Force on
Clinical Practice Guidelines, which aim to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease through cholesterol management (Grundy, et. al., 2018).
The blood lipids measurements in NHANES include
total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides. The present file provides data on HDL-C.
Data on total cholesterol are provided in Cholesterol - Total TCHOL_L, and LDL-C and triglyceride data are provided
in TRIGLY_L. </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined
participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal;">High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) </strong></p>
<p>This automated HDLC4 assay uses detergents, cholesterol esterase (CHER),
cholesterol oxidase (CHOD), and peroxidase to form a colored pigment that is
measured optically. The HDLC4 assay meets the 1998 National Institutes of
Health (NIH) / National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) goals for
precision and accuracy.</p>
<p>In this method, non‑HDL lipoproteins such as LDL, VLDL, and chylomicrons
are combined with polyanions and a detergent, forming a water‑soluble complex. In this
complex, the enzymatic reaction of CHER and CHOD towards non‑HDL lipoproteins is blocked. Finally,
only HDL‑particles can react with CHER and CHOD. The concentration of HDL‑cholesterol
is determined enzymatically by CHER and CHOD. Cholesterol esters are broken
down quantitatively into free cholesterol and fatty acids by CHER.</p>
<p>Refer to the Laboratory Method Files
section for a detailed description of the laboratory methods used.</p>
<p>Serum HDL-C levels were calculated from directly measured values of total
cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-C. Please see below
the Data Processing and Editing section for more details. For laboratory methods
used for total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides, please refer to the
accompanying documentation:&nbsp; TCHOL_L and TRIGLY_L</p>
<p>There were no
changes to the lab method or lab site for this component in the NHANES August
2021 - 2023 cycle. However, the lab equipment used changed from
the Cobas
6000 Analyzer to the Cobas
8000 during the cycle.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Serum specimens
were processed, stored, and shipped to the University of Minnesota,
Minneapolis, MN for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2021-2023/manuals/2021-Laboratory-Procedures-508.pdf">Laboratory
Procedures Manual (LPM)</a>. Vials are stored
under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they are shipped to
University of Minnesota for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are
discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2021-2023/manuals/2021-Laboratory-Procedures-508.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs)</strong></p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical
Laboratories </strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and
distributed a QC protocol for all the contract laboratories, which outlined the
use of Westgard rules (Westgard et. al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens.
Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt
of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument
calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS
quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The
laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p>
<p>One derived
variable was created in this data file. The variable was created using the
following formula:</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal;">LBDHDDSI</strong></p>
<p>HDL-cholesterol in
mg/dL (LBXHDD) was converted to mmol/L (LBDHDDSI) by multiplying by 0.02586. </p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>There are over 800
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analyst should evaluate the extent of missing data in the
dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables
used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item
non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic
Guidelines</a> and the on-line <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">NHANES </a><a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">Tutorial</a> for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic
issues.</p>
<p><strong>Phlebotomy Weights <br />
<br />
</strong>For the August 2021-August 2023 cycle, analysis of nonresponse
patterns for the phlebotomy component in the MEC examination revealed
differences by age group and race/ethnicity, among other characteristics. For
example, approximately 67% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the
MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults
aged 18 and older provided a blood specimen. Therefore, an additional
phlebotomy weight, WTPH2YR, has been included in this data release to address
possible nonresponse bias. Participants
who are eligible but did not provide a blood specimen have their phlebotomy weight
assigned a value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records. The phlebotomy weight should be used for analyses
that use variables derived from blood analytes, and is included in all relevant
data files.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and
Other Related Variables</strong><br />
</p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2021">NHANES
August 2021-August 2023 Demographics File </a>contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2021-2022/FASTQX_L.htm">Fasting
Questionnaire File</a><a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/fastqx_j.htm" target="_blank"> </a>includes auxiliary
information, such as fasting status, length of fast and the time of
venipuncture.</p>
<p>This laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong></p>
<p>The detection
limit was constant for the analyte in the data set.</p>

<p><strong>No Correction Need for HDL-Cholesterol
Results for NHANES August 2021 - August 2023</strong></p>
<p>A method validation (bridging) study was performed to compare results from
an instrument change in the August 2021-August 2023 cycle. The Cobas 6000
Chemistry Analyzer was upgraded to the Cobas 8000 Chemistry Analyzer during the
cycle. Randomly selected serum samples (n=178) from previous NHANES were
measured using both instruments and the results were used to conduct the
analysis. On average, HDL-Cholesterol values measured from the Cobas 6000 were 0.91%
higher than values from the Cobas 8000 (p = 0.0001). Data from the bridging
study indicated the correlation coefficient (r) between the measurements was
0.997. Regression analyses were performed using Analyse-it, v4.30.4. The
weighted Deming regression equation did not show a significant slope or
intercept (95% confidence interval [CI] for slope included 1 and for intercept
included 0 (mg/L):</p>
<p>Cobas 8000 = 0.05591 + 0.9894 * (Cobas 6000); 95% CI of slope (0.9780 to 1.001)
and intercept (-0.5311 to 0.6429).</p>
<p>Therefore, the NHANES August 2021-August 2023 HDL-Cholesterol values did
not have to be adjusted.</p></div>
