        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>In 2015, diabetes was
the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. More than 30 million
Americans are living with diabetes, and 86 million are living with prediabetes,
which is a serious health condition that increases a person&rsquo;s risk of type-2
diabetes and other chronic diseases. The prevalence of diabetes and overweight
(one of the major risk factors for diabetes) continues to increase. Substantial
new efforts to prevent or control diabetes have begun, including the Diabetes
Prevention Trial and the National Diabetes Education Program.</p>
<p>Diabetes testing
provides population data to: 1) determine a national estimate of diabetes
prevalence (diagnosed and undiagnosed); 2) identify the risk factors; 3) permit
a national cohort to be established for follow-up studies of this condition;
and 4) provide critical information to clinicians and public health officials
for the development of preventive care and community-based interventions.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Participants aged
12 years and older, who were examined in the morning session, were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p><b>Glucose </b><br />
In this enzymatic method glucose is converted to glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) by
hexokinase in the presence of ATP, a phosphate donor. Glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase then converts the G-6-P to gluconate-6-P in the presence of
NADP+. As the NADP+ is reduced to NADPH during this reaction, the resulting
increase in absorbance at 340 nm (secondary wavelength = 700 nm) is measured.
This is an endpoint reaction that is specific for glucose. </p>
<p>Refer to the
Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory methods
used. </p>
<p>There were no changes to the lab site or lab method for this component in
the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle. There were no changes to the lab equipment since
2015-2016.&nbsp;The Cobas C311 analyzer was used in 2017-2018 and 2015-2016. Refer to analytic note for changes to equipment in earlier survey cycles, which
may impact analysis.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Plasma specimens are
processed, stored, and shipped to the University of Missouri-Columbia,
Columbia, MO for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM). </a>Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they
are shipped to University of Missouri-Columbia for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES LPM.</a></p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs) </b></p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract consultants
use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate
both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality control procedures.
Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical
Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and
distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined
the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981) when running NHANES specimens.
Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt
of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument
calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS
quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The
laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or
improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation. <br />
<br />
One variable was created in this data file. The variable was created using the
following formulas: <br />
<br />
<b>LBXGLU and LBDGLUSI:</b> <br />
The fasting glucose value in mg/dL (LBXGLU) was converted to mmol/L (LBDGLUSI)
by multiplying by 0.05551 (rounded to 3 decimals).</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017 - 2018 Laboratory Data Overview </a>for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a> and the on-line <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">NHANES Tutorial </a>for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Subsample Weights <br />
<br />
</b>Glucose was measured in a fasting subsample of participants 12 years and older. Specific sample weights (WTSAF2YR) for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data. Participants included in the fasting subsample but did not provide a blood specimen (n=145) have an assigned sample weight value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records. In addition, participants whom provided blood specimen but did not meet the 8 to less than 24  hour fasting criteria (n=180) have the sample weight value assigned as &ldquo;0&rdquo; (WTSAF2YR =0) as well. Glucose measurements for these 180 participants are included in the dataset. However, to include these data in the analysis, a reweighting would be required. <br />
<br />
<b>Demographic and Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2017">NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics File</a> contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.</p>
<p>In the 2017-2018
NHANES cycle, the variables PHAFSTHR
(total length of &ldquo;food fast&rdquo;, hours) and PHAFSTMN (Total length of &ldquo;food fast&rdquo;, minutes) will not be reported in this file. PHAFSTHR
and PHAFSTMN can be found in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/fastqx_j.htm">Fasting Questionnaire File</a> (FASTQX_J). The fasting questionnaire data file also includes additional auxiliary
information such as fasting status, and the time of venipuncture.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>The
detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending &ldquo;LC&rdquo;
(ex., LBDGLULC<i>) </i>indicates whether the
result was below the limit of detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result
was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result was below
the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXGLU<i>) </i>provides the analytic result for that
analyte.&nbsp; For analytes with
analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex., LBDGLULC=1),
an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is
the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). </p>
<p>The lower limit of
detection (LLOD, in mg/dL) for fasting glucose: </p>

There
were equipment changes during the 2015-2016, 2007-2008, and 2005-2006 survey
cycles. For analysis involving 2015-2016 data and data collected prior to
2007-2008 cycle, please refer to the documentation accompanying those data for
additional information on any needed adjustments to the data prior to analysis.
If 2017-2018 data are compared or combined with the 2015-2016 data, no
adjustments are needed for equipment changes. As mentioned in the 2015-2016
documentation, most of the 2015-2016 samples were measured using the Cobas C311,
which is the same instrument used in 2017-2018. Some of the samples were
collected using the Cobas C501. Results for these specimens have already been
adjusted using the forward regression equation for comparability. Please see
the 2015-2016 fasting plasma glucose documentation for more information about
using backwards or forwards regression models to account for equipment changes
between cycles (include link to documentation here).</p></div>
