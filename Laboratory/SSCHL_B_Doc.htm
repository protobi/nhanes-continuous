This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was modified to remove records (<5% of records) that were initially included in error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous file. However, not all possible analyses were performed.

        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p><b>Introduction<br />
</b>It has been proposed that racial/ethnic variation in prostate cancer incidence may be, in   part, due to racial/ethnic variation in sex steroid hormone levels. However, it remains unclear whether in the US population circulating concentrations of sex steroid hormones vary by race/ethnicity. To address this, concentrations of testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, androstanediol glucuronide (a metabolite of dihydrotestosterone) and estradiol were measured in stored serum specimens from men selected for the 1/3 subsample where organochlorine pesticide levels were determined. This data file contains results of the testing of 1554 males age 12 or more years who were part of that sub sample and for whom serum was still available in the repository. Data Documentation for each of these four components is given in sections below.</p>
<p><strong>Testosterone</strong> <br />
The androgen testosterone (17ß-hydroxyandrostenone) has a molecular weight of 288 daltons. In men, testosterone is synthesized almost exclusively by the Leydig cells of the testes. The secretion of testosterone is regulated by luteinizing hormone (LH), and is subject to negative feedback via the pituitary and hypothalamus. Testosterone promotes the development of the secondary sex characteristics in men and serves to maintain the function of the prostate and seminal vesicles. Most of the circulating testosterone is bound to carrier proteins (SHBG = sex hormone-binding globulin). In women, small quantities of testosterone are formed in the ovaries. In physiological concentrations, androgens have no specific effects in women. Increased production of testosterone in women can cause virilization (depending on the increase). The determination of testosterone in women is helpful in the diagnosis of androgenic syndrome (AGS), polycystic ovaries (Stein-Leventhal syndrome) and when an ovarian tumor, adrenal tumor, adrenal hyperplasia or ovarian insufficiency is suspected. Testosterone is determined in men when reduced testosterone production is suspected, e.g. in hypogonadism, estrogen therapy, chromosome aberrations (as in the Klinefelter’s syndrome) and liver cirrhosis.</p>
<p>Elecsys Testosterone is based on a competitive test principle using a monoclonal antibody specifically directed against testosterone. Endogenous testosterone released from the sample by ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid) and norgestrel competes with the added testosterone derivative labeled with ruthenium complex for the binding sites on the biotinylated antibody.</p>
<p><b>Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)</b> <br />
Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is the blood transport protein for testosterone and estradiol. It is a large glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 95 kD, and exists as a homodimer composed of two identical subunits. Each subunit contains two disulfide bridges.<sup> (</sup>Petra PH, 1991) Planar C18 and C19 steroids with a 17a-hydroxyl group bind particularly well, (Avvakumov GV et al., 2001; Hammond GL, 1995) whereas C19 17-ketosteroids such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstendione do not bind so easily. SHBG has a high binding affinity to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), medium affinity to testosterone and estradiol, and only a low affinity to estrone, DHEA, androstendione, and estriol. SHBG binds reversibly to sexual steroids. Albumin, which exists in far higher concentrations than SHBG, also binds sexual steroids – although with a clearly lower binding affinity (e.g. about 100 times lower for testosterone). SHBG has a half-life of about 7 days and is produced mainly by the liver. Its synthesis and secretion are regulated by estrogen (Burger HG, 2002; Davis S, 2001). SHBG serum concentrations depend on the extent, duration, and the kind of estrogen applied, and how regulation takes place. Androgens and gestagens with androgenic residual action have the opposite effect. In the serum SHBG mainly takes over the transportation of steroids and the reduction/regulation of the effect of androgen. (Rosner W et al., 1999; Burger HG et al., 2002) Decreased SHBG serum levels are associated with conditions where elevated androgen levels are present or where the effect of androgen on its target organs is excessive. This explains the gender-related differences seen between men and women, especially during puberty.</p>
<p>Measurement of SHBG can be an important indicator of an excessive/chronic androgenic action where androgen levels are normal, but where clinical symptoms would seem to indicate androgen in excess. SHBG is a useful supplementary parameter in the determination of androgen where a relatively high concentration of free androgen (e.g. testosterone) is suspected (Pugeat M et al., 1996).</p>
<p>By calculating the free androgen index (FAI), also called free testosterone index (FTI), from the ratio of total testosterone (TT) to SHBG [% FAI or FTI = (TT/SHBG) * 100], it is possible to calculate the approximate amount of free testosterone (FTc), as there is a direct correlation between FAI and FT. By additionally taking the non-specifically albumin-bound testosterone into account, it is possible to calculate the bioavailable testosterone (BATc), which is the sum of free testosterone and the albumin-bound testosterone fraction, calculated via the association constant to albumin. Only free testosterone is biologically active, and it best indicates the clinical situation of the patient. Free and bioavailable testosterone are also referred to as non-SHBG-bound testosterone and can be obtained by precipitation of the SHBG-bound-testosterone with ammonium sulfate, and by equilibrium dialysis (Vermeulen A, 1999 et al., Morley JE et al., 2002).</p>
<p>Elevated SHBG levels can be seen in elderly men, and are often found in patients with hyperthyroidism and cirrhosis of the liver. SHBG levels also increase when oral contraceptives or antiepileptic drugs are taken. Pregnant women have markedly higher SHBG serum concentrations due to their increased estrogen production. </p>
<p>Decreased SHBG concentrations are often seen with hypothyroidism, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), obesity, hirsutism, elevated androgen levels, alopecia, and acromegaly.</p>
<p>Elecsys SHBG employs two monoclonal antibodies specifically directed against human SHBG. Cross-reactivity with ??1-fetoprotein (AFP), corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), DHT, estradiol, fibrinogen, human immunoglobulin A (IgA), human immunoglobulin G (IgG), plasminogen, thyroxine binding globulin (TBG), testosterone, thyroglobulin (Tg), transferrin, and thyrotropin (TSH) is negligible.</p>
<p>Androstanediol glucuronide 5a-Androstane-3a, 17ß-diol glucuronide is a C19 steroid and is either abbreviated as 3a Diol G, 5a Diol G or simply, a Diol G. It is produced mainly as a metabolite of testosterone and ihydrotestosterone (DHT). It is largely produced in target peripheral tissues such as the skin, especially around hair follicles. The stimulation by large amounts of 3a Diol G leads to excessive hair formation, notably where hair is not normally present in women.</p>
<p>In recent years the interest in the measurement of this steroid has increased among clinical investigators studying women suffering from idiopathic hirsutism.</p>
<p>Among the steroids known to be precursors for 3a Diol G are dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstenedione and testosterone. Only 3a Diol G has been shown to increase with hirsutism and decrease with treatment. This correlation has also been demonstrated in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCO). 3a Diol G determinations have therefore proved to be a useful indicator in a variety of ways including monitoring the progress of treatment of idiopathic hirsutism and women with PCO.</p>
<p>Furthermore, diabetic patients (both men and women) under cyclosporine A therapy have shown increased 3a Diol G levels, a side effect resulting in the appearance of hair in previously hairless areas.</p>
<p><b>Estrogens<br />
</b>Estrogens are responsible for the development of the secondary female sex characteristics. Together with gestagens they control all the important female reproductive processes. The biologically most active estrogen is 17 ß-estradiol. This is a steroid hormone having a molecular weight of 272 daltons. Estrogens are produced primarily in the ovary (follicle, corpus luteum), but small quantities are also formed in the testes and in the adrenal cortex. During pregnancy, estrogens are mainly formed in the placenta. About 98% of estradiol is bound to transport proteins (SHBG = sex hormone binding globulin). Estrogen secretion is biphasic during the menstrual cycle. The determination of estradiol is utilized clinically in the elucidation of fertility disorders in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis, gynecomastia, estrogen-producing ovarian and testicular tumors and in hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex. Further clinical indications are the monitoring of fertility therapy and determining the time of ovulation within the framework of in vitro fertilization (IVF).</p>
<p>Elecsys Estradiol II employs a competitive test principle using a polyclonal antibody specifically directed against 17 ß-estradiol. Endogenous estradiol released from the sample by mesterolone competes with the added estradiol derivative labeled with a ruthenium complex for the binding sites on the biotinylated antibody.</p>

The principle of the following enzyme immunoassay test follows the typical competitive binding scenario. Competition occurs between an unlabeled antigen (present in standards, control and patient samples) and an enzyme-labeled antigen (conjugate) for a limited number of antibody binding sites on the microwell plate. The washing and decanting procedures remove unbound materials. After the washing step, the enzyme substrate is added. The enzymatic reaction is terminated by addition of the stopping solution. The absorbance is measured on a microtitre plate reader. The intensity of the color formed is inversely proportional to the concentration of 3a Diol G in the sample. A set of standards is used to plot a standard curve from which the amount of 3a Diol G in patient samples and controls can be directly read.</p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Calibration</span> <br />
Traceability: This method has been standardized via ID-GC/MS (&ldquo;isotope dilution-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry&rdquo;). Every Estradiol II reagent set has a barcoded label containing the specific information for calibration of the particular reagent lot. The predefined master curve is adapted to the analyzer by the use of Elecsys Estradiol II CalSet II. <br />
Calibration frequency: Calibration must be performed once per reagent lot using fresh reagent (i.e. not more than 24 hours since the reagent kit was registered on the analyzer). Renewed calibration is recommended as follows: <br />
<em>Elecsys 2010:</em> <br />
&bull; after 1 month (28 days) when using the same reagent lot <br />
&bull; after 7 days (when using the same reagent kit on the analyzer) <br />
For all analyzers: <br />
&bull; as required: e.g. quality control findings outside the specified limits <br />
Calibration verification: Not necessary. The analyzer&rsquo;s software automatically checks the validity of the curve and draws attention to any deviations. </p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p><b>Testosterone<br />
