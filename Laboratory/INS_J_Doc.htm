        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Insulin is the
primary hormone responsible for controlling glucose metabolism, and its
secretion is determined by plasma glucose concentration. The insulin molecule
is synthesized in the pancreas as pro-insulin and is later cleaved to form
C-peptide and insulin. The principal function of insulin is to control the
uptake and utilization of glucose in the peripheral tissues. Insulin
concentrations are severely reduced in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
(IDDM) and some other conditions, while insulin concentrations are raised in
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), obesity, and some endocrine
disorders.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Participants aged
12 years and older, who were examined in the morning session, were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>The AIA-PACK IRI is a two-site immunoenzymometric assay,
which is performed on Tosoh AIA System analyzer. This assay is designed for the
quantitative measurement of Insulin (IRI) in human serum. Insulin present in
the test sample is bound with monoclonal antibody immobilized on a magnetic
solid phase and enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody in the AIA-PACK. The
magnetic beads are washed to remove unbound enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody
and are then incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl
phosphate (4MUP). The amount of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody that binds
to the beads is directly proportional to the insulin concentration in the test
sample. A standard curve is constructed, and unknown sample concentrations are
calculated using this curve.</p>

<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed

<p><b>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs) </b><br />
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical
Laboratories </b><br />
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by
the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind
split samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens. </p>
<p>NCHS developed and
distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined
the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981) when running NHANES specimens.
Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt
of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument
calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS
quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The
laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation.</p>
<p>One variable was
created in this data file.&nbsp; The variable
LBDINSI was created using the following formula:</p>
<p><b>LBDINSI: </b>The insulin value in &micro;U/mL (LBXIN) was converted to pmol/L (LBDINSI) by
multiplying by 6.0 (rounded to 2 decimals). </p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017" target="_blank">2017-2018 </a><a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017" target="_blank">Laboratory Data Overview</a> for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80% of children aged
1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through
phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older provided a blood
specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset
related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables used in
the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item non-response
is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to
the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">NHANES </a><a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic Guidelines</a> and the on-line <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">NHANES </a><a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">Tutorial</a> for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Subsample Weights</b></p>
<p>Insulin was measured
in a fasting subsample of participants 12 years and older. Specific sample weights (WTSAF2YR) for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.&nbsp; Participants included in the fasting subsample but
did not provide a blood specimen (n=145) have an assigned sample weight value of
&ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records. In addition, participants whom provided blood specimen
but did not meet the&nbsp;8 to less than 24  hour fasting criteria (n=180) have the sample weight
value assigned as &ldquo;0&rdquo; (WTSAF2YR =0) as well. Five out of these 180 participants
did not provide enough volume to have their insulin tested. Insulin
measurements for the other 175 participants are included in the dataset.
However, to include these data in the analysis, a reweighting is required.
There are another 61 participants in the fasting subsample that did not
provide enough blood; therefore, they did not have insulin measured. However,
these participants have data in at least one other fasting subsample tests
(e.g., plasma fasting glucose). Therefore, they have a
sample weight larger than &ldquo;0,&rdquo; regardless of missing their insulin test results.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and
Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2017" target="_blank">NHANES
2017-2018 Demographics File </a>contains demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews
as well as the sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance
estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU,
respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>This laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p>In the 2017-2018
NHANES cycle, the variables PHAFSTHR (total length
of &ldquo;food fast&rdquo;, hours) and PHAFSTMN (Total length of
&ldquo;food fast&rdquo;, minutes) will not be reported in this file. PHAFSTHR and
PHAFSTMN can be found in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/fastqx_j.htm" target="_blank">Fasting Questionnaire File (FASTQX_J)</a>.&nbsp; The fasting questionnaire data file also
includes additional auxiliary information, such as fasting status, and the time
of venipuncture.</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>The
detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending &ldquo;LC&rdquo;
(ex., LBDINLC<i>) </i>indicates whether the
result was below the limit of detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result
was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result was below
the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXIN<i>) </i>provides the analytic result for that
analyte. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex., LBDINLC=1),
an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is
the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). </p>
<p>The lower limit of
detection (LLOD, in uU/mL) for insulin is:</p>
