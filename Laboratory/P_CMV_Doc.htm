        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program suspended field
operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not
completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore,
data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES
2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March
2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to
the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a herpes virus, which can be a
serious pathogen in infants and adults.&nbsp; CMV
usually does not cause significant disease in healthy individuals, but pregnant
women can transmit CMV to their unborn babies, who are then at risk. Congenital
CMV infection is a significant source of morbidity among children, causing a
wide range of clinical outcomes including jaundice, hydrocephalia, hearing loss,
ocular lesions, and even death. Currently, about one out of every 200 babies are
born with congenital CMV infection each year. </p>
<p>In the United States, one in three children are already
infected with CMV by age five. Young children with CMV infection shed the virus
in high titers and are a major source of transmission to other susceptible
children and adults, which is of special concern for pregnant women. For this
reason, characterizing infection among children less than 6 years old is
essential to expanding our understanding of important transmission exposures,
mainly breastfeeding and close contact during childcare, and patterns of
primary and recurrent infections. Such information would inform the development
of prevention strategies to protect vulnerable populations, including pregnant
women and their fetuses.</p>
<p>Additionally, young children have been identified as a
potential target population for CMV vaccine development, recently ranked of
highest priority by the Institute of Medicine. Describing the serological
profile of children under the age of 6 would improve our understanding of
immunity during early childhood and facilitate vaccine development. </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined participants aged 1 to 5 years, in
the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample, were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>
CMV Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are detected by enzyme-linked
fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA) in a semiquantitative-automated manner, using
the VIDAS CMV method designed by Biomerieux. All NHANES specimen numbers were
scanned by the barcode reader. The VIDAS instrument reads the specimen
reactivity of each sample and assigns numeric values. </p>
<p>Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a
detailed description of the laboratory methods used.</p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

the National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Detailed instructions on specimen collection and
processing instructions are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf" target="_blank">NHANES 2017-2018 </a>and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf" target="_blank">2019-2020 Laboratory Procedures Manuals </a>(LPMs).&nbsp; Vials were stored under appropriate frozen
(-30<sup>o</sup>C) conditions until they were shipped to the National Center
for Infectious Diseases for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC)
protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf" target="_blank">NHANES LPMs</a>. </p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed
for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing
procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels
were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods
include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.
1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed.&nbsp;
Incomplete data and improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory
for confirmation.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19
pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020
after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020
sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because
the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally representative, these
data were combined with data from the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process was applied
to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in
the present file should be used to calculate estimates from the combined
cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate for independent analyses of
the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative results for
either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer
to the NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with
specific weights for that 2-year cycle. </p>

Laboratory Data Overview</a> documents for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. For example, in 2019-2020, approximately 71% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC
provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 94% of examined adults age
18 and older provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of
missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional
re-weighting for item non-response is necessary. </p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic Guidelines </a>and
the on-line NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">Tutorial</a> for details on the
use of sample weights and analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020" target="_blank">2017-March2020 Pre-pandemic Demographics File </a>contains demographic data, health indicators, and other
related information collected during household interviews as well as the sample
design variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires
use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.</p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES
data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>Since this data is reported as qualitative data, the use of
lower limit of detections (LLODs) isn&rsquo;t applicable. </p></div>
