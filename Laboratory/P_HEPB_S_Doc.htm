        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program suspended field operations in
March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a
result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and
the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore,
data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES
2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March
2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to
the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>Hepatitis viruses
constitute a major public health problem because of the morbidity and mortality
associated with the acute and chronic consequences of these infections.&nbsp;Because of the
high rate of asymptomatic infection with these viruses, information about the
prevalence of these diseases is needed to monitor prevention efforts. By
testing a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population, NHANES
provides the most reliable estimates of age-specific prevalence needed to
evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies to prevent these infections. NHANES
testing for markers of infection with hepatitis viruses is used to determine
secular trends in infection rates across most age and racial/ethnic groups, and
provides a national picture of the epidemiologic determinants of these
infections.</p>
<p>Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver most
often caused by a virus. Viral hepatitis is a major public health problem of
global importance because of the ongoing transmission of viruses that cause the
disease and increased morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and
chronic consequences of these infections. Global and US goals have been
established for elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by
2030 (HHS Healthy People, 2022 and HHS 2020). </p>
<p>In the US, the most common types of viral
hepatitis are hepatitis A, B, and C. Effective vaccines are available to help
prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B. No vaccine is available for hepatitis C;
however, highly effective, well-tolerated treatment can cure hepatitis C virus
infection. Hepatitis D virus infection is less common in the US and can occur
only among persons with hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis E infection also
is less common in the US. These five hepatitis viruses, also called
hepatitides, are well-characterized for detection with laboratory assays and
are monitored in U.S. public health surveillance systems.</p>
<p>NHANES viral hepatitis data are used to monitor
progress toward goals in <em>Healthy People </em>and the HHS <em>Viral Hepatitis
National Strategic Plan</em>, which in turn support US and global viral
hepatitis elimination goals (HHS Healthy People, 2022 and NASEC, 2017). The
viral hepatitis laboratory and interview components of NHANES complement data
from outbreak, case-based surveillance, vital statistics, health care systems,
and cohort studies that can provide timely, detailed, or longitudinal
information for subnational geographic areas and disproportionately affected
populations, such as persons experiencing homelessness or living in
correctional facilities; however, these sources lack information available from
NHANES, such as race, ethnicity, education, income, and health status and
behaviors. </p>
<p>Viral hepatitis data from NHANES are available
beginning with the Second NHANES conducted during 1976-1980 for hepatitis A and
hepatitis B, and with the Third NHANES conducted during 1988-1994 for hepatitis
C, hepatitis D and hepatitis E. </p>
<p>An
estimated 300 million people worldwide are persistent carriers of hepatitis B
virus (HBV). Infection with HBV results in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic
liver diseases that may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Transmission of HBV occurs by percutaneous exposure to blood products and
contaminated instruments, sexual contact and perinatally from HBV-infected
mothers to their unborn child. In 2022, U.S. vaccination guidelines were
updated to recommend hepatitis B vaccination for all infants, unvaccinated
children aged &lt;19 years, adults aged 19 through 59 years, and adults aged 60
years and older with risk factors for hepatitis B.</p>
<p>HBV infection produces an array of unique antigens and antibody
responses that, in general, follow distinct serological patterns.</p>
<p>Testing for hepatitis B surface
antibody contributes information important to distinguish immunity from
vaccination among persons who lack antibodies to hepatitis B core. Assay results
may be used as an aid in the determination of susceptibility to hepatitis B
virus (HBV) infection for individuals prior to or following HBV vaccination, or
where vaccination status is unknown.</p>
<p>The hepatitis B surface antibody
test is used in NHANES to assess immunity due to vaccination.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined participants aged 2 years or older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>Hepatitis B surface
antibody (anti-HBs) is measured
using the VITROS Anti-HBs Quantitative assay. The test is performed using the
VITROS Anti-HBs Quantitative Reagent Pack and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products
Anti-HBs Calibrators on the VITROS ECi/ECiQ or VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic
System.</p>

<p>Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">2017-2018 </a>and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf">2019-2020</a> Laboratory Procedures Manuals (LPMs). Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they were shipped to Division of Viral Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality assurance and quality control protocols (QA/QC) meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPMs.</p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs)</b> </p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical
Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in the demographic data file should be used to calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019">2019-2020</a> Laboratory Data Overview documents for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population characteristics. For example, in the 2017-March 2020 approximately 76% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults aged 18 and older provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a> and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial</a> for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. </p>
<p><strong>Demographic and Other Related Variables</strong>
</p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020"> NHANES 2017&ndash;March 2020 Demographics File</a> contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN). </p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong>
</p>
<p>This data is qualitative. The use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not applicable.</p></div>
