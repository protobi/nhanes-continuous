BFRs are not chemically bound to the flame-retarded material, so they can enter the environment from volatilization, leaching, or degradation of BFR-containing products. PBDEs are generally persistent in the environment and have been measured in aquatic sediments, house dust, and aquatic and terrestrial animals. PBDEs have been shown to bio accumulate in fish. Humans may be exposed though the diet, including breast feeding, and by contact with BFR-treated products and contaminated house dust.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-third subsample were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p><span>Eleven polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and PBB-153 were measured in serum through the use of automated liquid/liquid extraction and subsequent sample clean-up.

<p><b><span>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</span></b></p>
<p><span>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Analytical Laboratories</span></b></p>
<p><span>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</span></p>
<p><span>NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules </span><span>(Westgard, et al. 1981)</span><span> when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.</span></p>

and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial</a>
for details on the use of sample weights and analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Subsample Weights</b></p>
<p>The original pooled-sample weight created for this file
released in July 2013 was not correctly stratified to the U.S population total.
This new file contains the corrected sample weight (WTSMSMPA). No changes or
corrections were made to the lab analyte data in this new release. Any analyses
of the data using the old public use data file should be repeated using the
corrected sample weight on this file.</p>
<p>BFR including PBDEs and PBB-153 were measured in a one-third subsample of
participants 12 years older.&nbsp; Special sample
weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights
for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used when
analyzing these data. Samples were pooled in groups of 8
samples per pool within 40 demographic groups. The analysis of NHANES 2005-2006
pooled-sample data must be conducted with the basic demographic variables
provided in this data file. This pooled-sample data file cannot be linked to
other NHANES 2005-2006 data. Because each sample person does not have an equal
probability of selection, sample weighting is needed to produce correct
population estimates of means, percentiles, and other descriptive statistics. </p>
<p>The pooled-sample weights required to produce estimates
from these data are included in this data file.&nbsp; The analysis of
pooled-samples from survey data is a relatively new field of study, and there
is currently no established method to produce variance estimates for these
pooled results.&nbsp;&nbsp; These data cannot be analyzed using software
designed for complex surveys because design features are not available.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Demographic and Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2015">NHANES
2005-2006 Demographics</a> File contains demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews
as well as the sample design variables. The recommended procedure for variance
estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU,
respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Laboratory&amp;CycleBeginYear=2005">Fasting
Questionnaire File</a> includes auxiliary information, such as fasting
status, length of fast and the time of venipuncture. </p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES
data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><b>Rationale and Methods Used to Create Pooled Results</b></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
provide an ongoing assessment of the US population's exposure to environmental
chemicals by using biomonitoring in conjunction with CDC's National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Characterizing the distributions of
concentrations of environmental compounds or their metabolites in the US
population is a primary objective of CDC's biomonitoring program. Historically,
this characterization has been based on individual measurements of these compounds
in body fluid or tissue from representative samples of the population. Pooling
samples allows for larger sample volumes, which can result in lower limits of
detection and reduces the number of measurements and costs. For the first time
in NHANES 2005-2006, a weighted pooled-sample design was implemented to
facilitate pooling samples before making analytical measurements (pooled
results were not weighted in NHANES 2001-2002). Table 1 lists the IUPAC
(International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) names, common
abbreviation, and NHANES variable name for the analytes included in this data
file.</p>
<p>Pools were prepared from serum collected from a random one-third subset of
the NHANES 2005&ndash;2006 participants aged 12 years and older. Samples were pooled
based on gender, race and Hispanic origin, and age. To implement the
pooled-sample design, each participant sample was identified as belonging to
one of 32 demographic groups based on race and Hispanic origin (non-Hispanic
white: NHW, non-Hispanic black: NHB, Mexican American: MA,:&nbsp;not
non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white or Mexican-American: OTHER), gender
(Male, Female), and age group (12-19, 20-39, 40-59, and 60+ years of age and
older). Eight (8) samples were included in each pool. The number of pools
created for each of the 32 demographic groups varied depending on the total
number of individual samples available in a demographic group. The one-third
subset of NHANES 2005-2006 represents 2345 individual samples, but because the
pooled-sample design requires that all samples be of sufficient volume and that
there be the same number of samples in each pool, only 1973 samples were
available to create 247 pools with 8 samples per pool. &nbsp;See more details on pool sample formation and
exceptions in Table 2. The variable SAMPLEID denotes the identification
number for each pool and ranges from 1
through 247. Please refer to the Pooled-Sample Technical Support file (POOLTF_D)
for detailed information on individual participants included in each pool.</p>
<p>In order to incorporate sample weighting into the
pooled-sample design it was necessary to use a different volume of material
from each sample contributing to a pool. The volume chosen for each sample in a
pool was based on the ratio of its sampling weight to the sum of the sampling
weights of all samples in the pool. To physically accomplish the pooling in the
laboratory required that the ratio of the largest to the smallest sampling
weight of samples in the same pool be no larger than about 4 or 5. The individual
samples were sorted/stratified by sampling weight within each of the 32
demographic groups and pools were formed using samples with sampling weights
adjacent to one another in the sorted list. The number of samples in the
one-third subset, the number of samples available, the number of these samples
that were usable, and the number of pools formed in each demographic group are
presented in Table 2. Once the pools were created, summed sampling weights were
further adjusted to account for the unused samples. These adjusted summed
sampling weights are represented by the variable named WTSMSMPA.</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>In the dataset, the whole weight detection limit (pg/g
serum) is a variable and dependent on the available sample size, however, the
variation in sample size was low. Lipid adjusted detection
limits are variable (ng/g lipid) due to differences of the lipid levels
measured in individual pools/specimens. In cases where the result was below the
limit of detection, the value for that variable is the detection limit divided
by the square root of 2. </p>

Variance estimation and bias correction when pooling samples from log-normally
distributed populations (Caudill, 2010a; Caudill, 2010b; Caudill et al., 2007);
<br />
&bull; Models that incorporate measurement error when analyzing pooled-samples from
normally or log-normally distributed populations (Caudill, 2010a); <br />
&bull; Incorporation of sample weighting into a pooled-sample design (Caudill, 2012;
Caudill, 2010a); <br />
&bull; Estimation of standard errors and confidence limits for point estimates from
pooled-samples (Caudill, 2012; Caudill, 2010a).&nbsp; </p></div>
