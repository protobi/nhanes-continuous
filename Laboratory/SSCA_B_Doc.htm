        <h5 class="specialnote">Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021 and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified. This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was modified to remove records (5-<10% of records) that were initially included in error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous file. However, not all possible analyses were performed.</h5>

        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Sera from residual
specimens from NHANES 2001-2002 participants were tested for levels of cancer
antigen 125 (CA125) and cancer antigen 15.3 (CA15.3). The results for CA125 in
this data release are reported as U/mL. The results for CA15.3 are reported as
mU/mL. </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Female participants
age 20+ who consented to storing their samples for future research and had
stored samples from 2001-2002. </p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>All measurements were performed in the Genital Tract Biology
Laboratory (Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital, Lab Director) following pre-analytic,
analytic, and post-analytic standardized operational procedures (SOPs)
established under the Laboratory director and special chemistry accreditation
by the College of American Pathologists. The lab used the Meso Scale Discovery
(MSD) (Gaithersburg, MD) electrochemiluminescence immunoassay platform. Quality
control (QC) pools were prepared and split into multiple aliquots. To establish
inter-and intra-plate variability, one aliquot of this pool was repeatedly tested
on each assay plate. A coefficient of variation of &lt; 25% was set as a
threshold for acceptance of the data.</p>
<p>In further detail, the following assays and methodology were
applied:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Human CA125 (single spot, catalog number K151WC) </span></p>
<p>The linearity range for the CA125 was 10,000&ndash;0.6 U/ml
(low limit of detection (LLD) 0.286 U/ml). All samples were tested undiluted and
four samples were repeatedly tested to verify their top or bottom outlier
values. The QC pool for this assay was prepared by pooling a small volume (5
ul/ sample) from over 2000 serum samples which had shown well measurable levels
of CA125 in a prior study using the MSD platform.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Human Prototype CA15.3 (single spot catalog number
N45ZA-1) </span></p>
<p>The linearity range for the CA15.3 assay was 12,500&ndash;0.76
mU/mL (LLD=0.483 mU/ml). </p>
<p>All samples were tested at 25- or 50-fold dilution and
retested at 250-fold dilution if the first dilution resulted in values above
the linearity of the assay. The QC pool for this assay was prepared by pooling
1.5 ml per sample from seven samples from a pilot study previously tested on
the same assay and found to have high levels. All samples were tested at a
25-fold dilution chosen after multiple dilutions were screened to fit the assay
linearity range, and to correspond to the lowest dilution of the study samples.
Two CA15.3 assay plates were re-tested due to QC failure in the first run.</p>
<p>The unblinded quality control sample pool repeatedly
tested on every assay plate showed the following inter-plate CV and min&ndash;max range
(mean) of intraplate CV of the three QC dilutions tested: (i) CA125, 13% inter-plate
CV and 0.5%&ndash;22% (7%) intraplate CV; (ii) CA15.3: 19% inter-plate CV and 0%&ndash;17%
(4%) intraplate CV. </p><h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>The acceptable QC pool variation was set to 25%. Back fit analysis of each
calibrator was also set to 25% acceptable level.&nbsp; Outliers were confirmed by repeated testing and
samples outside the linearity range of each assay were repeatedly tested at
adjusted dilution to produce acceptable value.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Data was compiled into
a database after all the assays were completed and passed quality control
criteria. The data were not edited.</p>
<p>Data Access: All
data will be made publicly available.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Results were
measured as U/mL for CA125 and mU/mL for CA15.3</p>
<p>Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx"> Analytic Guidelines </a>and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/">Tutorial</a> for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
