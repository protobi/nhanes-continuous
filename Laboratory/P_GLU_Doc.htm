        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program suspended field
operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not
completed and the collected data are not nationally representative.
Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from
the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public.
Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the
data.</p>
<p>In 2015, diabetes
was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. More than 30
million Americans are living with diabetes, and 86 million are living with
prediabetes, which is a serious health condition that increases a person&rsquo;s risk
of type-2 diabetes and other chronic diseases. The prevalence of diabetes and
overweight (one of the major risk factors for diabetes) continues to increase.
Substantial new efforts to prevent or control diabetes have begun, including
the Diabetes Prevention Trial and the National Diabetes Education Program.</p>
<p>Diabetes testing provides
population data to: 1) determine a national estimate of diabetes prevalence
(diagnosed and undiagnosed); 2) identify the risk factors; 3) permit a national
cohort to be established for follow-up studies of this condition; and 4)
provide critical information to clinicians and public health officials for the
development of preventive care and community-based interventions.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All examined
participants 12 years and older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic
sample were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p><strong>Glucose </strong><br />
In this enzymatic method glucose is converted to glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) by
hexokinase in the presence of ATP, a phosphate donor. Glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase then converts the G-6-P to gluconate-6-P in the presence of
NADP+. As the NADP+ is reduced to NADPH during this reaction, the resulting
increase in absorbance at 340 nm (secondary wavelength = 700 nm) is measured.
This is an endpoint reaction that is specific for glucose. </p>

methods used. </p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Plasma specimens
are processed, stored, and shipped to the University of Missouri-Columbia,
Columbia, MO for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf">2019-2020 Laboratory Procedures Manuals</a>&nbsp;(LPM). Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C)
conditions until they are shipped to University of Missouri-Columbia for
testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the NHANES LPM.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs) </strong></p>
<p>Laboratory team
performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and contract
consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during visits to
evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each
laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical
Laboratories</strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses
several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by the
contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and
distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract laboratories, which outlined
the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981) when testing NHANES specimens.
Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or receipt
of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument
calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS
quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The
laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were
reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing
laboratory for confirmation. <br />
<br />
One variable was created in this data file. The variable was created using the
following formulas: <br />
<br />
<strong>LBXGLU and LBDGLUSI:</strong> <br />
The fasting glucose value in mg/dL (LBXGLU) was converted to mmol/L (LBDGLUSI)
by multiplying by 0.05551 (rounded to 3 decimals).</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19
pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020
after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020
sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because
the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally representative, these
data were combined with data from the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process was applied
to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in
the present file should be used to calculate estimates from the combined
cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate for independent analyses of
the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative results for
either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer
to the NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with
specific weights for that 2-year cycle. </p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019">2019-2020 Laboratory Data Overview</a>&nbsp;documents
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants.
However, not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all
the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or
other population characteristics. For example, in 2017-March 2020,
approximately 76% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC
provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age
18 and older provided a blood specimen. &nbsp;Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for
item non-response is necessary. </p>
<p>Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic
Guidelines</a> and the on-line NHANES <a href=" https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial </a>for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><strong>Subsample Weights</strong><br />
<br />
Glucose was measured in a fasting subsample of
participants 12 years and older. Specific sample weights (WTSAFPRP) for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used when
analyzing these data. Participants included in the fasting subsample but did
not provide a blood specimen (n=346) have an assigned sample weight value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their
records. In addition, participants whom provided blood specimen but did not
meet the 8 to less than 24 hour fasting criteria (n=268) have the sample weight value assigned as
&ldquo;0&rdquo; (WTSAFPRP=0) as well. Glucose measurements for these&nbsp;268 participants are
included in the dataset. However, to include these data in the analysis, a
reweighting would be required. <br />
<br />
<strong>Demographic and Other Related Variables</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020">2017-March 2020 Pre-Pandemic Demographics File</a> contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>In the 2017-March
pre-pandemic NHANES cycle, the variables PHAFSTHR (total length of &ldquo;food fast&rdquo;,
hours) and PHAFSTMN (Total length of &ldquo;food fast&rdquo;, minutes) will not be reported
in this file. PHAFSTHR and PHAFSTMN can be found in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2020/p_fastqx.htm">Fasting Questionnaire File</a> (P_FASTQX). The fasting questionnaire
data file also includes additional auxiliary information such as fasting
status, and the time of venipuncture.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This laboratory
data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong></p>
<p>The detection
limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two variables are
provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex.,
LBDGLULC<em>) </em>indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection:
the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo;
indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed
LBX (ex., LBXGLU<em>) </em>provides the analytic result for that analyte.&nbsp;
For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
LBDGLULC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt[2]). </p>

detection (LLOD, in mg/dL) for fasting glucose: </p>

<p><strong>Comparability with
previous cycles&nbsp;</strong><br />
</p>
<p>There were equipment
changes during the 2015-2016, 2007-2008, and 2005-2006 survey cycles. For
analysis involving 2015-2016 data and data collected prior to 2007-2008 cycle,
please refer to the documentation accompanying those data for additional
information on any needed adjustments to the data prior to analysis. If 2017-March
2020 pre-pandemic data are compared or combined with the 2015-2016 data, no
adjustments are needed for equipment changes. As mentioned in the 2015-2016
documentation, most of the 2015-2016 samples were measured using the Cobas
C311, which is the same instrument used in 2017-2018. Some of the samples were
collected using the Cobas C501. Results for these specimens have already been
adjusted using the forward regression equation for comparability. Please see
the 2015-2016 fasting plasma glucose documentation for more information about
using backwards or forwards regression models to account for equipment changes
between cycles (include link to documentation here).</p></div>
