        <h5 class="specialnote">Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021 and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified. This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was modified to remove records (5-<10% of records) that were initially included in error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous file. However, not all possible analyses were performed.</h5>

        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Sera from residual
specimens from NHANES 2001-2002 participants were tested for levels of human epididymal
secretory protein E4 (HE4). The results for HE4 in this data release are reported
as pM.&nbsp; </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Female participants
age 20+ who consented to storing their samples for future research and had
stored samples from 2001-2002. </p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>All measurements were performed in the Genital Tract Biology Laboratory
(Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital, Lab Director Fichorova) following pre-analytic,
analytic, and post-analytic standardized operational procedures (SOPs)
established under the Laboratory Director and special chemistry accreditation
by the College of American Pathologists. The lab used the Meso Scale Discovery
(MSD) (Gaithersburg, MD) electrochemiluminescence immunoassay platform. Quality
control (QC) pools were prepared and split into multiple aliquots. To establish
inter-and intra-plate variability, one aliquot of this pool was repeatedly
tested on each assay plate. A coefficient of variation of &lt; 25% was set as a
threshold for acceptance of the data.</p>
<p>In further detail, the following assays and methodology were applied:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Human Prototype HE4 (96-well prototype plate 4 spot, catalog number N45YA-1)
</span></p>
<p>The linearity range for the HE4 was 3600&ndash;0.55 pM (lowest limit of detection
(LLD) 0.006 pM). All samples were tested undiluted and 47 samples were
repeatedly tested to verify values &lt;1 and &gt;99 percentile. One plate was
repeated due to systematically lower/outlier values. Three QC samples were used
spanning three logs of the assay range: 1) a plasma pool prepared by pooling a
small volume (5 ul/ sample) from over 2000 serum samples which had shown measurable
HE4 levels in a prior study using the MSD platform<sup>1,2</sup>; 2) a QC
generated from a standard of known HE4 concentration; 3) a plasma pool prepared
by pooling samples obtained from a cohort of ovarian cancer cases. </p>
<p>The unblinded quality control sample pool repeatedly tested on every assay
plate showed the following inter-plate CV and min&ndash;max range (mean) of intraplate
CV of the three QCs tested: (i) QC #1, 18.3% inter-plate CV and 0.2%&ndash;9.2% (2.9%)
intraplate CV; (ii) QC #2: 21.25% inter-plate CV and 0.2%&ndash;14.4% (3.3%)
intraplate CV; and &nbsp;iii) QC #3: 15.04%
inter-plate CV and 0.3%&ndash;12.3% (3.1%) intraplate CV.&nbsp; </p><h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>The acceptable QC pool variation was set to 25%. Back fit analysis of each
calibrator was also set to 25% acceptable level.&nbsp; Outliers were confirmed by repeated testing and
samples outside the linearity range of each assay were repeatedly tested at
adjusted dilution to produce acceptable value.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Data was compiled into
a database after all the assays were completed and passed quality control
criteria. The data were not edited.</p>
<p>Data Access: All
data will be made publicly available.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Results were
measured as pM.</p>
<p>Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to
the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines </a>and the on-line NHANES&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/">Tutorial</a>&nbsp;for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p></div>
