        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Soluble transferrin
receptor (sTfR) is a measure of iron deficiency and is particularly useful in
persons with inflammation, infection, or chronic disease, where ferritin levels
do not correlate with true iron levels. Low storage of iron can lead to
iron deficiency anemia. High levels of iron storage, also called iron overload,
occurs when excess iron is accumulated in the body, primarily the liver.</p>
<p>The objectives of
this component are: 1) to provide data for monitoring secular trends in
measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 2) to evaluate the
effects of people's habits and behaviors, such as physical activity and the use
of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on nutritional status; and 3) to
evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and public health policies,
including welfare reform legislation, food fortification policy, and child
nutrition programs on the nutritional status of the U.S. population. </p>
<p>These
data will be used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific nutrients
in the population and subgroups, to provide population reference data, and to
estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors to serum
levels of nutrients. Data will be used for research to further define nutrient
requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and health
promotion.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>
Examined participants aged 1 to 5 years and 12 years and older were eligible.
</p>
<p>
</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>The method principle for measurement of sTfR is a particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric
assay that uses Roche kits on the Cobas&reg; c501 clinical analyzer. Latex particles
coated with anti-sTfR antibodies react with the antigen in the sample to form
an antigen/antibody complex. Following agglutination, the precipitate is determined
photometrically. </p>
<p>Refer to the
Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory
methods used.</p>
<p>There were no changes
to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this component in the NHANES
2017-2018 cycle. </p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Serum samples were
processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National
Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, GA for analysis. </p>
<p>Detailed instructions
on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)</a>.&nbsp; Vials are stored under
appropriate frozen (-30&deg;C) conditions until they are shipped to National Center
for Environmental Health for testing. </p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>. </p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</b></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed
for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing
procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels
were maintained.</p>
<p><b>Analytical Laboratories</b></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods
include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.
1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were
followed. Reported results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory
Sciences&rsquo; QA and QC performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to
the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al. 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or
improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation.</p>
<p>One variable was created in this data file. The variable LBDTFRSI was
created using the following: </p>
<p>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><b>LBDTFRSI</b>: The transferrin receptor value
in mg/L (LBXTFR) was converted to nmol/L (LBDTFRSI) by multiplying LBXTFR by
11.8. </p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017 - 2018 Laboratory Data Overview</a> for general information on
NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC
provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age
18 and older provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of
missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether the data are
useable without additional re-weighting for item non-response. </p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic
Guidelines</a> and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">Tutorial</a> for details on the use of sample
weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and Other Related Variables</b></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2017">NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics File</a>
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/fastqx_j.htm">Fasting
Questionnaire File</a> includes auxiliary information, such as fasting
status, length of fast, and the time of venipuncture. </p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES
data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><b>Detection Limits</b></p>
<p>The
detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in
&ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex., LBDTFRLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result was below the limit of detection.&nbsp; For analytes with analytic
results below the lower limit of detection (ex., LBDTFRLC =1),
an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is
the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The
other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXTFR<i>,
</i>provides the analytic result for that analyte.</p>
<p>The lower limit of detection (LLOD in mg/L)&nbsp;for LBXTFR:&nbsp;</p>
