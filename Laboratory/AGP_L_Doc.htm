        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Alpha-1-Acid Glycoprotein (AGP) is synthesized in the
liver and structurally belongs to the lipocalin superfamily of secretory
proteins, such as retinol-binding protein and alpha-1-microglobulin (Schmid,
1975). AGP is a sensitive acute phase reactant whose concentration can increase
by a factor of 3 within 24-48 hours when inflammation occurs (Tietz, 1995). It
can also be used to differentiate between acute phase reactions (elevated serum
level) and estrogen effects (normal or decreased serum level); whereas, the
serum level of other positive reactants, such as ceruloplasmin and haptoglobin,
increases during such reactions (Ganrot, 1974). Moderate and isolated increases
occur when glomerular filtration is inhibited in the early stages of uremia.
The determination is used in the assessment of the activity of acute and
recurring inflammations as well as of tumors with cell necrosis (Ganrot,
1974).&nbsp; </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined
participants 1-5 years old and 12-49 years old females were eligible. </p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>The Tina-quant Roche AGP
assay is based on the principle of immunological agglutination. Anti- alpha-1-acid
glycoprotein antibodies react with antigen in the sample to form an
antigen/antibody complex. Following agglutination, this is measured
turbidimetrically.</p>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Serum specimens
were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory Sciences,
National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed instructions
on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2021-2023/manuals/2021-Laboratory-Procedures-508.pdf">NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)</a>. Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions
until they are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are
discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2021-2023/manuals/2021-Laboratory-Procedures-508.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</strong></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed
for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing
procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels
were maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical Laboratories</strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods
include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et. al.,
1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were
followed. Reported results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory
Sciences&rsquo; QA/QC performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the
Westgard rules (Caudill, et. al., 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or
improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a> and the on-line <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx">NHANES Tutorial</a> for details
on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><strong>Phlebotomy Weights</strong> <br />
<br />
For the August 2021-August 2023 cycle, analysis of nonresponse patterns for the phlebotomy component in the MEC examination revealed differences by age group and race/ethnicity, among other characteristics. For example, approximately 67% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults aged 18 and older provided a blood specimen. Therefore, an additional phlebotomy weight, WTPH2YR, has been included in this data release to address possible nonresponse bias. Participants who are eligible but did not provide a blood specimen have their phlebotomy weight assigned a value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; in their records. The phlebotomy weight should be used for analyses that use variables derived from blood analytes, and is included in all relevant data files.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and Other Related Variables</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2021">NHANES August 2021-August 2023 Demographics
File</a> contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2021-2022/FASTQX_L.htm">Fasting
Questionnaire File</a> includes auxiliary information, such as fasting
status, length of fast, and the time of venipuncture. </p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES
data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong></p>
<p>The
detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending &ldquo;LC&rdquo;
(ex., LBDAGPLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection:
the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo;
indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed
LBX (ex., LBXAGP) provides the analytic result for that analyte.&nbsp; For analytes with analytic
results below the lower limit of detection (ex., LBDAGPLC=1),
an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the
lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). </p>
<p>The lower limit of detection (LLOD in ng/mL)&nbsp;for LBXFER:&nbsp;<em style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal;"> </em></p>
