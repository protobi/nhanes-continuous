        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Fluoride is a natural element found at
varying concentrations in drinking water and soil. Water and water-based
beverages are the primary source of dietary fluoride. Approximately 80% of
dietary fluoride comes from tap and bottled water (Palmer, 2005 and EPA, 2010).
Fluoride is voluntarily added to some drinking water systems as a public health
measure for reducing the incidence of cavities among the treated population.
The decision to fluoridate a water supply is made by the state or local
municipality and is not mandated by EPA or any other federal entity. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides recommendations about
the optimal levels of fluoride in drinking water needed to prevent tooth decay.
For community water systems that add fluoride to their water, the U.S. Public
Health Service (USPHS) recommends a fluoride concentration of 0.7 mg/L (parts
per million [ppm]) to maintain tooth decay prevention benefits and reduce the
risk of dental fluorosis (Gooch, 2015). Kidneys represent
the major route of fluoride removal from the body. Under normal conditions,
roughly 60% of fluoride absorbed each day by healthy adults (18&ndash;75 years) is
excreted in urine.</p>
<p>In 2010, a panel
of federal scientists representing CDC/Division of Oral Health and National
Institute of Dental (DOH) and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) participated in the
development of a new HHS recommendation for optimal fluoride level in drinking
water (community water fluoridation), as well as the development of guidelines
for maximum fluoride levels in naturally fluoridated water. One of the
recommendations of the federal panel was to strengthen the surveillance of
dental caries and dental fluorosis with emphasis on determining fluoride
exposures.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined
participants aged 6 to 19 years were eligible. </p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>Fluoride is measured in urine samples using an
ion-selective electrode (ISE), which measures the activity of fluoride ions as
a voltage response. The voltage response is proportional to the concentration
of free fluoride ions in solution when the ionic strength is fixed. It is
therefore essential that a total ionic strength adjustment buffer (TISAB) is
used with each sample. In addition to adjusting the ionic strength with sodium
chloride (NaCl), TISAB contains a complexing agent that binds with interfering
ions and buffers the solution to a pH of 5 thus reducing OH- and HF
interferences.</p>

Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory
methods used.</p>

        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Urine samples were
processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National
Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, GA for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM).
</a>Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement&nbsp;Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed
in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">NHANES LPM.</a></p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination
Centers (MECs) <br />
</strong>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed
for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing
procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels
were maintained. <br />
<br />
<strong>Analytical Laboratories</strong> <br />
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed by
the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind
split samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens. <br />
<br />
NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981) when
testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered
during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control
pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences&rsquo; QA/QC performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al. 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable
values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015">2015 - 2016 Laboratory Data Overview</a>
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the
dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables
used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item
non-response is necessary. </p>
<p>Please refer to
the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">NHANES Analytic Guidelines</a>
and the on-line <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnchs%2Ftutorials%2Findex.htm">NHANES Tutorial
</a>for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and
Other Related Variables</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of
NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design
and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2015">NHANES
2015-2016 Demographics File </a>contains demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews
as well as the sample weight variables. The recommended procedure for variance
estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU,
respectively) in the demographic data file.</p>
<p>This laboratory
data file can be linked to other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong> </p>
<p>The detection limits were constant for the analyte in the
data set. Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The
variable name ending &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex., URDUFLLC) indicates whether the result was
below the limit of detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or
above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result was below the limit
of detection. The other variable prefixed UBX (ex., URXUFL) provides the
analytic result for that analyte. For analytes with analytic
results below the lower limit of detection (ex., URDUFLLC=1),
an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the
lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). </p>

detection (LLOD, in&nbsp;mg/L) for fluoride: </p>
